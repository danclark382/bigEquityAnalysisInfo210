We will pay interest on the notes on June&nbsp;15 and December&nbsp;15 of each year, commencing December&nbsp;15, 2019. Interest on the notes will accrue from and including June&nbsp;19, 2019.
We may redeem the notes at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at the redemption prices described in this prospectus supplement under the caption "Description of

Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company&reg;, is an S&amp;P&nbsp;500 company dedicated to providing stockholders with dependable monthly dividends that increase
over time. We are structured as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, requiring us annually to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains) in the form of dividends
to our stockholders. Our monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow generated from real estate owned under long-term, net lease agreements with regional and national commercial tenants. As of
March&nbsp;31, 2019, we owned a diversified portfolio of 5,876 properties located in 49 states and Puerto Rico, with over 95.2&nbsp;million square feet of leasable space leased to 261 different
commercial tenants doing business in 48 separate industries. </FONT></P>

dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. We are structured as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, requiring us annually to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding
net capital gains) in the form of dividends to our stockholders. Our monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow generated from real estate owned under long-term, net lease agreements with
regional and national commercial tenants. We seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders through active portfolio management, asset management and the acquisition of additional
properties. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of March&nbsp;31, 2019, we owned a diversified portfolio of 5,876 properties located in 49 states and Puerto Rico, with over 95.2&nbsp;million square feet of leasable space leased
to 261 different commercial tenants doing business in 48 separate industries. Of the 5,876 properties in the portfolio, 5,847, or 99.5%, were single-tenant properties, and the remaining were
multi-tenant properties. At March&nbsp;31, 2019, of the 5,847 single-tenant properties, 5,748 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the

Acquisitions During the First Three Months of 2019  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first three months of 2019, we invested $519.5&nbsp;million in 105 new properties and properties under development or expansion,
with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 6.7%. The 105 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 25 states, will contain approximately
2.3&nbsp;million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of 17.0&nbsp;years. The tenants occupying the new properties operate in 14&nbsp;industries and the
property types are 98.7% retail and 1.3% industrial, based on rental revenue. During the first three months of 2019, none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10% or more of our
total assets at March&nbsp;31, 2019. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

The Sainsbury's Transaction  </B></FONT></P>

J&nbsp;Sainsbury&nbsp;PLC ("Sainsbury's") and British Land&nbsp;PLC for &pound;429.0&nbsp;million under long-term net lease agreements with Sainsbury's (the "Sainsbury's Transaction"),

Capital Raising  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2019, Realty Income issued 12,650,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a public offering price of $69.25 per
share. A substantial portion of the net proceeds of approximately $845.0&nbsp;million from the offering was used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our $3.0&nbsp;billion
revolving credit facility, and to the extent not used for that purpose, remaining net proceeds have been or will be used to fund investment opportunities and/or for other general corporate purposes. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also
in May 2019, Realty Income closed a private placement of &pound;315.0&nbsp;million senior unsecured notes due 2034 (the "2034 Sterling Notes"). The 2034 Sterling Notes have
a fixed interest rate of 2.73%. Net proceeds from the private placement were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Sainsbury's Transaction, and, to the extent not used for that purpose,
to fund potential investment opportunities and/or for other general corporate purposes. </FONT></P>

Revolving Credit Facility and Credit Agency Ratings  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2018, we entered into a new $3.25&nbsp;billion unsecured credit facility to replace our previous $2.25&nbsp;billion unsecured
credit facility, of which $2.0&nbsp;billion was due to expire in June 2019. This new credit facility includes a $3.0&nbsp;billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a new
$250.0&nbsp;million unsecured term loan due March 2024. The new revolving credit facility matures in March 2023 and includes two six-month extensions that, subject to certain terms and conditions,
can be exercised at our option. Our revolving credit facility also has a $1.0&nbsp;billion expansion feature that, subject to certain terms and conditions, can be exercised at our option. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
borrowing interest rates under our revolving credit facility are equal to a base interest rate (which is variable) plus a spread that is based on the ratings assigned to our senior
unsecured debt securities by credit rating agencies. Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor's Ratings Group has assigned a rating of A&#150; with a "stable" outlook, Moody's Investors Service has assigned
a rating of A3 with a "stable" outlook and Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+ with a "stable" outlook. As of March&nbsp;31, 2019, our investment grade credit ratings provided for financing
of revolving credit borrowings at an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.775% with a facility commitment fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.90% over
LIBOR. Our revolving credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i)&nbsp;LIBOR, plus 1.45% if our credit rating is lower than BBB&#150;/Baa3 or if our senior
unsecured debt is unrated and (ii)&nbsp;LIBOR, plus 0.75% if our credit rating is A/A2 or higher. In addition, our revolving credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our </FONT></P>

Key Financial Covenants  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes will require that we comply with certain financial covenants described in this prospectus supplement under "Description of
Notes&#151;Additional Covenants of Realty Income." In general and subject to exceptions, these covenants provide: (i)&nbsp;that we may not incur any Debt (as defined below under "Description
of Notes&#151;Additional Covenants of Realty Income") if, on a pro forma basis, our total Debt would exceed 60% of our Adjusted Total Assets (as defined below under "Description of
Notes&#151;Additional Covenants of Realty Income"), (ii)&nbsp;that we may not incur any Debt if, on a pro forma basis, our debt service coverage ratio (calculated as described below under
"Description of Notes&#151;Additional Covenants of Realty Income&#151;Debt Service Coverage") would be less than 1.5 to 1.0, (iii)&nbsp;that we may not incur any Secured Debt (as
defined below under "Description of Notes&#151;Additional Covenants of Realty Income") if, on a pro forma basis, our total Secured Debt would exceed 40% of our Adjusted Total Assets, and
(iv)&nbsp;that we must maintain at all times Total Unencumbered Assets (as defined below under "Description of Notes&#151;Additional Covenants of Realty Income") of not less than 150% of our
total outstanding Unsecured Debt (as defined below under "Description of Notes&#151;Additional Covenants of Realty Income"). The following table shows the foregoing percentages and ratio as
required by those covenants as well as our actual percentages and ratio calculated as provided in those covenants as of, or, in the case of the debt service coverage ratio, for, the four quarters
ended March&nbsp;31, 2019. These calculations, which are not based on generally accepted accounting principles, are presented to show our ability to incur additional debt under those covenants and
do not purport to reflect our liquidity, actual ability to incur or service debt or our future performance. These calculations do not reflect the impact of, among other things, the issuance and sale
of the notes offered hereby or the application of the estimated net proceeds therefrom and, as a result, our actual percentages and ratios after giving effect to this offering and the application of
those proceeds will differ, perhaps significantly, from those set forth below. Moreover, the foregoing is a very general overview of some of the terms of those covenants and those covenants are
subject to a number of important exceptions and limitations and you should carefully review the information, including the definitions of some of the capitalized terms used above, appearing under
"Description of Notes&#151;Additional Covenants of Realty Income," as well as the indenture and the applicable officers' certificates under which the notes will be issued, for more information.
In addition, as required by the debt service coverage covenant referred to above, our debt service coverage ratio for the four quarters ended March&nbsp;31, 2019 as set forth under the caption
"Actual" in the following table has been calculated on a pro forma basis on the assumption that (1)&nbsp;the incurrence of any Debt incurred by us since the first day of such four-quarter period and
the application of the proceeds therefrom (including to refinance other Debt since the first day of such four-quarter period) had occurred on the first day of such period, (2)&nbsp;the repayment or
retirement of any of our other Debt since the first day of such four-quarter period had occurred on the first day of such period (except that, in making such computation, the amount of Debt under any

We are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our $3.0&nbsp;billion unsecured revolving credit
facility. At March&nbsp;31, 2019, we had $838.0&nbsp;million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, a total of $5.4&nbsp;billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt
securities (excluding unamortized original issuance premiums of $10.3&nbsp;million and deferred financing costs of $32.5&nbsp;million), $500.0&nbsp;million of borrowings outstanding under our
senior unsecured term loans (excluding deferred financing costs of $1.3&nbsp;million) and approximately $297.1&nbsp;million of outstanding mortgage debt (excluding net unamortized premiums
totaling $4.0&nbsp;million and deferred financing costs of $169,000 of this mortgage debt), and we had approximately $544.0&nbsp;million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit
facility on June&nbsp;7, 2019. Our revolving credit facility grants us the option, subject to customary conditions, to expand the borrowing limits thereunder to up to $4.0&nbsp;billion. In May
2019, we also issued &pound;315.0&nbsp;million of senior unsecured debt in connection with the Sainsbury's Transaction. We also may in the future enter into amendments and restatements of our
current revolving credit facility and term loan facilities, which may increase the amounts we are entitled to borrow, subject to customary conditions, compared to our current revolving credit facility
and term loan facilities, or we may incur other indebtedness. To the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. As a result,
we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt, including the notes offered
hereby. We also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility, our term loans and some of our mortgage debt are variable and could therefore increase over
time. We also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due. Given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing global financial crisis and related
uncertainties, including the impact of the United Kingdom's advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union (referred to as Brexit), we also face the risk that one or more of the participants
in our revolving credit facility may not be able to lend us money. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, our revolving credit facility, our term loan facilities and mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or, in certain cases, prohibit the payment of
dividends and other distributions to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock. In particular, our revolving credit facility and our two $250.0&nbsp;million term loan
facilities, all of which are governed by the same credit agreement, provide that, if an event of default (as defined in the credit agreement) exists, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries (other than
our wholly-owned subsidiaries) may pay any </FONT></P>

Although these notes are referred to as "senior" notes, they will be effectively subordinated to all
liabilities of our subsidiaries, including any guarantees of our indebtedness by any of our subsidiaries, and will be subordinated to our secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing that
indebtedness.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes offered hereby will be our obligations exclusively and will not be the obligations of, or guaranteed by, any of our subsidiaries, nor
are any of our subsidiaries required to provide funds to us, whether by dividend, loan or otherwise, to make payments on the notes. As a result, the notes will be effectively subordinated in right of
payment to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries from time to time outstanding, including any guarantees of our indebtedness by any of our subsidiaries. In the
event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings involving any of our subsidiaries, the creditors of that subsidiary (including, in the case of any subsidiary that may in the future guarantee
any indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility or $250.0&nbsp;million term loan facilities, the lenders under those facilities) will generally be entitled to payment of their
claims from the assets of that subsidiary before any of those assets are made available for distribution to us, except to the extent that we may also have a claim as a creditor of that subsidiary, in
which case our claims would still be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured debt of that subsidiary (to the extent of the value of the collateral pledged as
security therefor) and would be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us. As of March&nbsp;31, 2019, our subsidiaries had
approximately $458.1&nbsp;million of total indebtedness and other liabilities (excluding liabilities owed to us and other intercompany liabilities) and we and our subsidiaries had approximately
$297.1&nbsp;million of secured indebtedness outstanding. None of our subsidiaries currently guarantees our borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility or under our
$250.0&nbsp;million term loan facilities. However, under our revolving credit facility and our $250.0&nbsp;million term loan facilities, if any of our subsidiaries guarantees or otherwise becomes
obligated with respect to any of our or any of our subsidiaries' other existing or future indebtedness (subject to limited exceptions), then any such subsidiary would be required to become a guarantor
under those facilities. Furthermore, we may voluntarily cause any of our subsidiaries to become a guarantor under our revolving credit facility and our $250.0&nbsp;million term loan facilities to
the extent we consider appropriate to remain in compliance with certain covenants under these facilities. Although the indenture under which the notes will be issued and other debt instruments to
which we are a party limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, both we and our subsidiaries have the right to incur substantial additional secured and
unsecured indebtedness. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
notes are unsecured and therefore will be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such indebtedness. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding involving us, our assets which serve as collateral for our secured indebtedness must first be
applied to repay our secured
indebtedness before being applied to pay any of our other indebtedness or liabilities, including the notes. Likewise, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding involving any of
our subsidiaries, any assets of that subsidiary that serve as collateral for its secured indebtedness must first be applied to repay such secured indebtedness before being applied to pay any of its
other indebtedness or liabilities or, if applicable, being provided to us. As of June&nbsp;7, 2019 we (including our subsidiaries) had approximately $295.9&nbsp;million of secured indebtedness
outstanding. Further, we may be required, under certain limited circumstances, to post cash collateral under our revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility includes a facility for the
issuance of standby letters of credit for our account, which letters of credit are to be issued by two of the lenders that are party to the revolving credit facility. Each other lender that is a party
to the revolving credit facility is obligated to reimburse such lenders if letters of credit are drawn upon, in an amount (the "L/C Reimbursement Amount") that is proportionate to its commitment to
make loans under the revolving credit facility. If any lender </FONT></P>

any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition. As a result, a tenant may delay lease
commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or
failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant's lease and material losses to us. </FONT></P>

tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties. Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for properties that are
re-leased, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements or lease transaction
costs. Negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. Any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow

offered hereby. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in
rental revenue from the properties. In a weakened financial condition, tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant's lease or leases. In addition, a bankruptcy court might authorize the
tenant to terminate its leases with us. If that happens, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent
payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against a tenant for terminated leases. In addition, any claim we
have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full, or at all. Moreover, in the case of a tenant's leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy, we may be required or elect
to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions, reducing amounts we receive under those leases. As a result, tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. Any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our
ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
March&nbsp;31, 2019, 102 of our properties were available for lease or sale, all of which were single-tenant properties. At March&nbsp;31, 2019, 71 of our properties under lease
were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants, all of which were current with their rent and other obligations. During the first three months of 2019, none of our tenants accounted for
more than 10% of our rental revenue. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the first three months of 2019, our tenants in the "convenience store" industry accounted for approximately 12.2% of our rental revenue. A downturn in this industry could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness, including the notes offered
hereby, and to make distributions to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individually,
each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue for the first three months of 2019. Nevertheless, downturns in
these industries could also adversely affect our tenants, which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal
of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby, and to make distributions to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, some of our properties are leased to tenants that may have limited financial and other resources, and therefore, they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn
in their respective businesses or in the regional, national, or international economy. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding, single-tenant, net lease retail locations
in the United States. For example, as described above under "Prospectus Supplement Summary&#151;Recent Developments&#151;The Sainsbury's Transaction," in May 2019, we completed the
Sainsbury's Transaction, which represented our first international real estate investment. We may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and/or new jurisdictions
outside the United States and properties leased to tenants engaged in non-retail businesses. These risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties, new types of real
estate locations and lease structures, and the laws and culture of non-United States jurisdictions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain of our existing debt instruments and other financial arrangements, including our $3.0&nbsp;billion revolving credit facility and our
$250.0&nbsp;million term loan facilities, provide for borrowings to be made at variable interest rates that use the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR (or metrics derived from or related to
LIBOR), as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate applicable to outstanding borrowings thereunder, and we may incur additional indebtedness or enter into new financial arrangements that use
LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate for borrowing thereunder. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. In 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority
announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established
or the establishment of alternative reference rates. These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities,
loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could also affect interest rates and other financing costs under our debt instruments and other financial
arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate the net proceeds from the sale of the notes offered by this prospectus supplement, after deducting the underwriting discount but
before deducting other estimated expenses payable by us, will be approximately $493.5&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings outstanding under our $3.0&nbsp;billion revolving credit facility, and to the extent not used for that purpose,
to fund potential investment opportunities and/or for other general corporate purposes. On June&nbsp;7, 2019, we had approximately $544.0&nbsp;million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving
credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility were generally used to acquire properties. Our revolving credit facility matures on March&nbsp;24, 2023, but may, at our option, be
extended by up to two six-month extensions, subject to certain terms and conditions. As of June&nbsp;7, 2019, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility was
approximately 3.2% per annum. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility that we repay with net proceeds from this offering may be reborrowed, subject to customary conditions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending
application of the net proceeds for the purposes described above, we may temporarily invest the net proceeds in short-term government securities, short-term money market funds
and/or bank certificates of deposit. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
$3.0&nbsp;billion revolving credit facility allows us to make and repay borrowings thereunder from time to time, subject to customary conditions, and we expect to make further
borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the future. Our revolving credit facility grants us the option to increase the amount of borrowings available thereunder by up to $1.0&nbsp;billion,
subject to certain terms and conditions. The interest rates under our revolving credit facility are equal to a base interest rate (which is variable) plus a spread that is determined on the basis of
the ratings assigned to our senior unsecured debt securities by credit rating agencies. As of March&nbsp;31, 2019, the interest rate under our revolving credit facility was equal to LIBOR plus a
spread of 0.775% with a facility commitment fee of 0.125%, for all in drawn pricing of 0.90% over LIBOR. The revolving credit facility provides that the interest rate ranges from: (i)&nbsp;LIBOR,
plus a spread of 1.45% if our credit rating is lower than BBB&#150;/Baa3 or if our senior unsecured debt is unrated to (ii)&nbsp;LIBOR, plus a spread of 0.75% if our credit rating is A/A2
or higher. In addition, our revolving credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which ranges from: (i)&nbsp;0.30% if our credit rating is lower than
BBB&#150;/Baa3 or if our senior unsecured debt is unrated, to (ii)&nbsp;0.10% if our credit rating is A/A2 or higher. The interest rates on borrowings under our $250.0&nbsp;million term
loan facilities are also subject to adjustment based on changes in our credit ratings. As of March&nbsp;31, 2019, we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our
senior unsecured notes and bonds: Moody's Investors Service had assigned a rating of A3 with a "stable" outlook, Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor's Ratings Group had assigned a rating of A&#150; with
a "stable" outlook, and Fitch Ratings had assigned a rating of BBB+ with a "stable" outlook. Based on our current ratings, our interest rates under our revolving credit facility and our
$250.0&nbsp;million term loan facilities are based on an A&#150;/A3 credit rating. We also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest
rates on these debt securities. If our credit ratings or credit ratings outlook change, the interest rate under our credit facilities and any other debt financing could increase or decrease. Likewise,
the interest rates on our revolving credit facility, our $250.0&nbsp;million term loan facilities and some of our mortgage indebtedness are variable and changes in prevailing interest rates will
result in changes in the interest rates under those borrowings, as well as the interest rates on debt securities we may issue and other borrowings we may make from time to time. Credit ratings are not
a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities (including the notes offered hereby) and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. </FONT></P>

"we," and "us" appearing under this caption "Description of Notes" and under the caption "Description of Debt Securities" in the accompanying prospectus mean Realty Income Corporation, a Maryland

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are permitted by the Indenture to issue our debt securities thereunder from time to time in one or more series. The notes will be a new,
separate series of our debt securities under the Indenture, limited initially in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000. The Indenture does not limit the amount of debt securities that we may
issue under the Indenture, and we may from time to time issue debt securities in one or more series up to the aggregate amount authorized by us for each series. We may, without the consent of the
holders of the notes, re-open this series of notes and issue additional notes of this series under the Indenture in addition to the notes offered pursuant to this prospectus supplement, and any such
additional notes shall be part of the same series of debt securities under the Indenture as the notes offered by this prospectus supplement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
notes will be issued only in fully registered form, without interest coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The principal of, and
premium, if any, and interest on, the notes will be payable in U.S. dollars. The notes will be evidenced by one or more global notes (collectively, the "Global Note") in book-entry form, except under
the limited circumstances described below under "&#151;Book-Entry System." Notices or demands to or upon Realty Income in respect of the notes and the Indenture may be served and, if notes are
issued in definitive certificated form, such notes may be surrendered for payment, registration of transfer or exchange, at the office or agency of Realty Income maintained for such purpose in Los
Angeles, California, which shall initially be the office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes will be our senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior
unsecured indebtedness. The notes will be our obligations exclusively, however, and will not be the obligations of, or guaranteed by, any of our subsidiaries, nor are any of our subsidiaries required
to provide funds to us, whether by dividend, loan or otherwise, to make payments on the notes. The notes will therefore be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future
indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries from time to time outstanding, including any guarantees of our indebtedness by any of our subsidiaries, and will also be subordinated in right of
payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries to the extent of the value of the collateral pledged as security therefor. As of March&nbsp;31, 2019, our
subsidiaries had outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities (excluding liabilities owed to us and other intercompany liabilities) aggregating approximately $458.1&nbsp;million and, as of
June&nbsp;7, 2019, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $295.9&nbsp;million of secured indebtedness outstanding. Also, none
of our subsidiaries currently guarantees any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or our $250.0&nbsp;million term loan facilities. As a result, the notes currently rank equally in right of
payment with borrowings under these facilities. However, under those facilities, if any of our subsidiaries guarantees or otherwise becomes obligated with respect to any of our or any of our
subsidiaries' other existing or future indebtedness (subject to limited exceptions), then any such subsidiary would be required to become a guarantor under our revolving credit facility and our
$250.0&nbsp;million term loan facilities. Additionally, we may voluntarily cause any of our subsidiaries to become a guarantor under these facilities to the extent we consider appropriate to remain
in compliance with certain covenants under these facilities. See "Risk Factors&#151;Although these notes are referred to as 'senior' notes, they will be effectively subordinated to all
liabilities of our subsidiaries, including any guarantees of our indebtedness by any of our subsidiaries, and will be subordinated to our secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing that
indebtedness." Although the Indenture and other debt instruments to which we are a party limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

been paid on the notes, payable semi-annually in arrears on June&nbsp;15 and December&nbsp;15 of each year (the "interest payment dates"), commencing December&nbsp;15, 2019, to the persons in
whose names the notes are registered in the security register applicable to the notes at the close of business on June&nbsp;1 or December&nbsp;1 (the "regular record dates"), as the case may be,

Book-Entry System  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are summaries of certain rules and operating procedures of The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, that affect the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on and transfers of interests in the Global Notes. Upon issuance, the notes will only be issued in the form of one or more Global Notes which will be held by
DTC or the Trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co., as nominee of DTC. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for notes in definitive form
under the limited circumstances described below, a Global Note may not be transferred except as a whole (1)&nbsp;by DTC to a nominee of DTC, (2)&nbsp;by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee
of DTC or (3)&nbsp;by DTC or any such nominee to a successor of DTC or a nominee of such successor. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ownership
of beneficial interests in a Global Note will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC ("participants") or persons that may hold interests through participants. Upon
the issuance of a Global Note, DTC will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the participants'
accounts with the respective principal amounts of the notes represented by such Global Note beneficially owned by participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Note will be shown on,
and the transfer of such ownership interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of participants) and on the records of participants (with respect to
interests of persons holding through participants). The laws of some states may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of the securities in definitive form. These laws
may limit or impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge beneficial interests in the Global Note. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of a Global Note, DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole Holder of the notes represented by such Global
Note for all purposes under the Indenture. Except under the limited circumstances set forth below, owners of beneficial interests in a Global Note will not be entitled to have notes represented by
such Global Note registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of such notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or Holders
of such notes under the Indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of DTC and, if such person is not a participant, on the procedures
of the participant through which such person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a Holder of notes under the Indenture. Realty Income understands that under existing industry practices, if
Realty Income requests any action of Holders of notes or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note desires to give or take any action that a Holder of notes is entitled to give or take
under the Indenture, DTC would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through
such participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners holding through them. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principal,
premium, if any, and interest payments on a Global Note will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner of such Global Note. None of Realty
Income, the Trustee or any other agent of Realty Income or agent of the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of
beneficial ownership of interests in the Global Note or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to beneficial ownership interests. Realty Income expects that DTC, upon receipt

responsibility of such participants </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Indenture provides that if (1)&nbsp;DTC notifies Realty Income that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or if DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered as such
under the Exchange Act at any time when the depositary is required to be so registered in order to act as depositary for the Global Notes and a successor depositary is not appointed within
90&nbsp;days after Realty Income receives such notice or learns of such ineligibility, (2)&nbsp;Realty Income determines that the notes shall no longer be represented by Global Notes and executes
and delivers to the Trustee an officers' certificate to that effect or (3)&nbsp;an event of default (as defined in the accompanying prospectus under "Description of Debt
Securities&#151;Events of Default, Notice and Waiver") with respect to the notes has occurred and is continuing and beneficial owners representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding notes advise DTC to cease acting as depositary for the Global Notes, Realty Income will issue notes in definitive form in exchange for interests in all outstanding Global Notes. Any
notes issued in definitive form in exchange for interests in a Global Note will be registered in such name or names, and will be issued in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof, as DTC shall instruct the Trustee. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by DTC from participants with respect to ownership of beneficial
interests in a Global Note. </FONT></P>

for the benefit of Clearstream Participants or Euroclear Participants. The sale proceeds will be available to the DTC seller on the settlement date. As a result, to a DTC participant, a cross-market
transaction will settle no differently than a trade between two DTC participants. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
a Clearstream Participant or Euroclear Participant wishes to transfer interests in Global Notes to a DTC participant, the seller will be required to send instructions to Clearstream
or Euroclear through a Clearstream Participant or a Euroclear Participant at least one business day prior to settlement. In these cases, Clearstream or Euroclear will instruct its U.S. agent to
transfer these notes against payment for them. The payment will then be reflected in the account of the Clearstream Participant or the Euroclear Participant the following day, with the proceeds back
valued to the value date, which would be the preceding business day, when settlement occurs in New York. If settlement is not completed on the intended value date, that is, the trade fails, proceeds
credited to the Clearstream or Euroclear Participant's account will instead be valued as of the actual settlement date. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
should be aware that you will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving the notes through Clearstream and Euroclear on the days when
those clearing systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States. In addition,
because of
time zone differences there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
we understand that DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers, they are under no obligation to perform these
procedures, and these procedures may be modified or discontinued at any time. </FONT></P>

In particular, as described below under "&#151;Conflicts of Interest," affiliates of some or all of the underwriters participating in this offering are lenders under our $3.0&nbsp;billion
revolving credit facility and our term loan facilities. Because we intend to use net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, lenders under that
credit facility that are affiliated with underwriters of this offering will receive net proceeds from this offering through the repayment of those borrowings under that facility. An affiliate of BNY

addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt
and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities
activities may involve securities

routinely hedge, and certain other of those underwriters or their respective affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically,
these underwriters and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short
positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The
underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and
may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. </FONT></P>

prospectus is part of an automatic shelf registration statement that we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as a "well-known seasoned issuer" as
defined in Rule&nbsp;405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, using a "shelf" registration process for the delayed offering and sale of securities pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;415 under the Securities Act. Under this shelf registration process, we may, from time to time, offer and sell any of the securities, or any combination of the securities, described in
this prospectus in one or more offerings. This prospectus only provides you with a general description of the securities that we may offer. Each time we sell securities, we will provide a prospectus
supplement and may provide you with a free writing prospectus or other offering materials (collectively, "offering materials") that will contain
specific information about the securities being offered and sold and the specific terms of that offering. The prospectus supplement or other offering materials may also add, update or change
information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus. If there is any inconsistency between the information in this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement or other
offering materials, you should rely on the information in the applicable prospectus supplement or other offering materials. Before purchasing any securities, you should carefully read this prospectus,
the applicable prospectus supplement and any other offering materials we may provide you in connection with the offering of those securities, together with the documents incorporated and deemed to be
incorporated by reference in this prospectus, which incorporated documents may be obtained as described under the headings "Where You Can Find More Information" and "Incorporation by Reference." </FONT></P>

information, we refer you to the registration statement, including its exhibits and any schedules. Statements contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus about the provisions or contents
of any contract, agreement or any other document referred to are not complete. For each of these contracts, agreements or documents filed as an exhibit to the registration statement or a document
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in this prospectus, we refer you to the actual exhibit for a complete description of the matters involved, and any statements contained or
incorporated by reference in this prospectus or any prospectus supplement or any other offering materials we may provide you regarding those contracts, agreements or other documents are subject to,

supplement to this prospectus and, if applicable, any other offering materials we may provide you. We have not authorized any other person to provide you with any information or to make any
representations other than those contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, any applicable prospectus supplement or any other offering materials prepared by or on behalf of us or to
which we have referred you. We take no responsibility for, and can provide no assurance as to the reliability of, any other information that others may give you. We will not offer or sell any
securities in any jurisdiction where, or to any person to whom, such offer or sale is not permitted. You should assume that the information appearing in this prospectus, the applicable prospectus
supplement and any other offering materials we may provide you in connection with an offering of securities is accurate only as of the respective dates of those documents, and that the information
appearing in any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in this prospectus or any accompanying prospectus supplement is accurate only as of the respective dates on which those

General  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prospectus describes certain general terms and provisions of our debt securities. When we offer to sell a particular series of debt
securities, we will describe the specific terms of the series in a prospectus supplement, a pricing supplement or other offering materials. We will also indicate in the supplement or other offering
materials whether the general terms and provisions described in this prospectus apply to a particular series of debt securities. Our debt securities will be our direct obligations and they may be
secured or unsecured, senior or subordinated indebtedness. We
may issue our debt securities under one or more indentures. Each indenture and the certificate or certificates evidencing the debt securities of each series will be in the form filed or incorporated
by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement containing this prospectus, a post-effective amendment to the registration statement or a document incorporated by reference herein and may be
obtained as described below under "Where You Can Find More Information." The form of indenture is subject to any amendments or supplements that may be adopted from time to time. We will enter into
each indenture with a trustee and the trustee for each indenture may be the same. Each indenture will be subject to, and governed by, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Unless otherwise
expressly stated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will be issued under an indenture dated as of October&nbsp;28, 1998 between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, N.A., as successor trustee, a copy of which has been incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement containing this prospectus. Because this description of debt
securities is a summary, it does not contain all the information that may be important to you and this description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the form of the
applicable indenture and the certificate evidencing the debt securities of the applicable series. You should read the applicable indenture and the form of certificate evidencing the applicable debt
securities in their entirety to assure that you have all the important information you need to make any required decisions. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, all
references to the "Company," "Realty Income," "our," "we" and "us" and all similar references appearing under this caption "Description of Debt Securities" mean Realty Income Corporation, a Maryland
corporation, excluding its subsidiaries. All other capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this section shall have the meanings set forth in the applicable indenture. </FONT></P>

Terms  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular terms of any series of our debt securities will be described in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials.
Additionally, any applicable modifications of or additions to the general terms of our debt securities, described in this prospectus and in the applicable indenture, will also be described in a
prospectus supplement or other offering materials. Accordingly, for a description of the terms of any series of our debt securities, you must refer to both the prospectus supplement or other offering
materials, if any, relating to those debt securities and the description of the debt securities set forth in this prospectus. If any particular terms of our debt securities, described in a prospectus
supplement or other offering materials, differ from any of the terms described in this prospectus, then those terms as set forth in the relevant prospectus supplement or other offering materials will
control. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
as set forth in any prospectus supplement or other offering materials, our debt securities may be issued without limit as to aggregate principal amount, in one or more series, in
each case as established from time to time by our board of directors, a committee of the board of directors or as set forth in the applicable indenture or one or more supplements to that indenture.
All of our debt securities of one series need not be issued at the same time, and unless otherwise provided, a series may be reopened for issuance of additional debt securities without the consent of
the holders of the debt securities of that series. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
indenture will provide that we may, but need not, designate more than one trustee for the indenture, each with respect to one or more series of our debt securities. Any trustee
under an indenture may resign or be removed with respect to one or more series of our debt securities, and a successor trustee may be appointed to act with respect to that series. If two or more
persons are acting as trustee to different series of our debt securities, each trustee shall be a trustee of a trust under the applicable indenture separate and apart from the trust administered by
any other trustee and, except as otherwise indicated in this prospectus, any action taken by a trustee may be taken by that trustee with respect to, and only with respect to, the one or more series of
debt securities for which it is trustee under the applicable indenture. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
charter authorizes our board of directors to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock into other classes or series of stock and to establish
the number of shares in each class or series and to set the terms, preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions,
qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption for each such class or series. Thus, the board of directors could cause the issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend rights, rights to
distributions in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voting rights or other rights that could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock or delay or prevent a
tender offer or change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interests, any of which could adversely affect the
market price of our common stock. For additional information, see "General Description of Preferred Stock" and "Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and of our Charter and Bylaws&#151;Effect of
Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and our Charter and Bylaws." </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the provisions of our charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock (see "Restrictions on Ownership and Transfers of Stock" below), each
outstanding share of our common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors (other than any directors to be elected
exclusively by holders of our outstanding preferred stock or any other class or series of our stock) and, except as provided with respect to any other class or series of stock, the holders of shares
of our common stock will possess the exclusive voting power. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holders
of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, which means that holders of more than 50% of all the shares of our common stock voting for
the election of directors can elect all the directors standing for election (other than any directors to be elected exclusively by holders of our outstanding preferred stock or any other class or
series of our stock) at the time if they choose to do so, and the holders of the remaining shares of our common stock cannot elect any such directors. All of our directors currently serve a one year
term. Holders of shares of common stock do not have preemptive rights, which means they have no right under the charter, bylaws, or Maryland law to acquire any additional shares of common stock that
may be issued by us at a subsequent date. Holders of shares of common stock have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund or redemption rights. Under Maryland law, stockholders generally are
not liable for the corporation's debts or obligations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, convert into another entity, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a share
exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business unless approved by its stockholders by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the
matter unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation's charter. Our charter provides that any such
action shall be effective if approved by the
affirmative vote of holders of shares entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Because the term "substantially all" of a company's assets is not defined in the
MGCL, it is subject to Maryland common law and to judicial interpretation and review in the context of the unique facts and circumstances of any particular transaction. Accordingly, there may be
uncertainty as to whether a sale of "substantially all" of our assets has taken place within the meaning of the MGCL provisions described above. </FONT></P>

the SEC after the date of this prospectus supplement and that are incorporated by reference herein or by information appearing in the applicable prospectus supplement or other offering materials we

Internal Revenue Code Requirements  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain our REIT status under the Code, no more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned, actually or

stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of a tenant of ours (or a tenant of any partnership or limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in
which we are a partner or member), the rent received by us (either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income
tests of the Code. A REIT's stock must also be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335&nbsp;days of a taxable year of twelve months or during a proportionate part of a shorter
taxable year. </FONT></P>

Transfer Restrictions in Charter  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we expect to continue to qualify as a REIT, our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock which,
among other purposes, are intended to assist us in complying with applicable Code requirements. Our charter provides that, subject to certain specified exceptions, no person or entity may own, or be
deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of
common stock. We refer to this restriction as the "ownership limit." The constructive ownership rules of the Code are complex, and may cause shares of common stock owned actually or constructively by
a group of related individuals and/or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of the shares of common stock (or the acquisition
of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, common stock) by an individual or entity, could nevertheless cause that individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to
constructively own more than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock and thus violate the ownership limit, or any other limit as provided in our charter or as otherwise permitted by our board of
directors. Our board of directors may, but in no event is required to, exempt from the ownership limit a particular stockholder if it determines that such ownership will not jeopardize our status as a
REIT. As a condition of such exemption, the board of directors may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to it and/or undertakings or representations
from the applicant with respect to preserving our REIT status. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
charter further prohibits (1)&nbsp;any person from actually or constructively owning shares of our common stock that would result in our being "closely held" under
Section&nbsp;856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, and (2)&nbsp;any person from transferring shares of our common stock if such transfer would result in shares of
our capital stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
person who acquires or attempts to acquire actual or constructive ownership of shares of our common stock that would violate any of the foregoing restrictions on transferability and
ownership is required to give notice to us immediately and provide us with such other information as we may request in order to determine the effect of such transfer on our status as a REIT. The
foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify,
as a REIT and such determination is approved by the holders of two-thirds of all shares entitled to vote on the matter, as required by our charter. Except as otherwise described above, any change in
the ownership limit would require an amendment to the charter. </FONT></P>

Effect of Violation of Transfer Provisions  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to our charter, if any purported transfer of common stock or any other event would result in any person violating the ownership limit
or such other limit as provided in the charter, or as otherwise permitted by our board of directors, or result in our being "closely held" under Section&nbsp;856(h) of the Code, or otherwise cause
us to fail to qualify as a REIT, then the number of shares that would otherwise cause such violation or result will be transferred automatically to a trust, the beneficiary of which will be a
qualified charitable organization selected by us. Such automatic transfer shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of such violative transfer. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within
20&nbsp;days of receiving notice from us of the transfer of shares to the trust, the trustee of the trust (who shall be designated by us and be unaffiliated with us and any
prohibited transferee or prohibited owner) will be required to sell such shares to a person or entity who could own the shares without violating the ownership limit, or any other limit as provided in
our charter or as otherwise permitted by our board of directors, and distribute to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner, as applicable, an amount equal to the lesser of the price paid by the
prohibited transferee or prohibited owner for such shares or the net sales proceeds received by the trust for such shares. In the case of any event other than a transfer, or in the case of a transfer
for no consideration (such as a gift), the trustee will be required to sell such shares to a qualified person or entity and distribute to the prohibited owner an
amount equal to the lesser of the market price (determined as provided in our charter) of such shares as of the date of the event resulting in the transfer or the net sales proceeds received by the
trust for such shares. In either case, any proceeds in excess of the amount distributable to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner, as applicable, will be distributed to the beneficiary. Prior
to a sale of any such shares by the trust, the trustee will be entitled to receive, in trust for the beneficiary, all dividends and other distributions paid by us with respect to such shares, and also
will be entitled to exercise all voting rights with respect to such shares. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to Maryland law, effective as of the date that such shares have been transferred to the trust, the trustee shall have the authority (at the trustee's sole discretion)
(1)&nbsp;to rescind as void any vote cast by a prohibited transferee or prohibited owner, as applicable, prior to the discovery by us that such shares have been transferred to the trust and
(2)&nbsp;to recast such vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the beneficiary. However, if we have already taken irreversible corporate action, then the
trustee shall not have the authority to rescind and recast that vote. Any dividend or other distribution paid to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner prior to the discovery by us that such
shares had been automatically transferred to a trust as described above will be required to be repaid to the trustee upon demand for distribution to the beneficiary. In the event that the transfer to
the trust as described above is not automatically effective (for any reason) to prevent violation of the ownership limit or any other limit as provided in our charter or as otherwise permitted by our
board of directors, then our charter provides that the transfer of such shares will be void. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, shares of our common stock held in the trust shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to us, or our designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;the
price per share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the trust (or, in the case of a devise or gift, the market price at the time of such devise or gift) and (2)&nbsp;the market
price on the date we, or our designee, accept such offer. We shall have the right to accept such offer until the trustee has sold the shares of common stock held in the trust. Upon such a sale to us,
the interest of the beneficiary in the shares sold shall terminate and the trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the prohibited </FONT></P>

between 0.5% and 5.0%, depending upon the number of record holders of our shares of stock. Under our charter, each common stockholder shall upon demand be required to disclose to us in writing such

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following summary of certain provisions of Maryland law and of our charter and bylaws does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and
qualified in its entirety by reference to, our charter and bylaws, copies of which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and to
the MGCL. See "Where You Can Find More Information." </FONT></P>

Election and Removal of Directors  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our charter and bylaws provide that our board of directors may establish the number of directors of our company as long as the number is not
fewer than the minimum number required under the MGCL, which is one, nor, unless our bylaws are amended, more than 15. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to our charter, each of our directors is elected by our stockholders to serve until the next annual meeting following his or her election and until his or her successor is duly
elected and qualifies. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to our bylaws, directors in uncontested elections are elected upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast for and against such nominee at a duly called
meeting of stockholders, and directors in contested elections are elected by a plurality of all of the votes cast. In both uncontested and contested elections, holders of shares of our common stock
have no right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. Consequently, at each annual meeting of stockholders, the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock will be able to elect
all of our directors. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the MGCL and our bylaws, except as otherwise provided in the terms of any class or series of our stock, vacancies on our board of directors created by any reason other than an
increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum, and any vacancy in the number of directors
created by an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire board. Any individual elected to fill a vacancy will serve until the next annual meeting of
stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
charter provides that, subject to the rights of holders of shares of one or more classes or series of preferred stock to elect or remove one or more directors, a director may be
removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. </FONT></P>

Amendment to Charter and Bylaws  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in the MGCL, amendments to our charter must be advised by our board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of our
stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our board of directors generally has the
power to amend our bylaws; provided, that, amendments to certain provisions in our bylaws related to a written statement required to be furnished to stockholders in the event of certain distributions,
our investment policy and restrictions, an annual report to stockholders and the definitions used in those sections of our bylaws must be approved by the affirmative vote of our stockholders entitled
to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Additionally, our bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast
on the matter pursuant to a binding proposal submitted for approval at any annual or special meeting of stockholders by any stockholder or group of up to five stockholders holding at least one percent
of the outstanding shares of our common stock for at least one year and who comply with the advance notice provisions in our bylaws. A stockholder proposal submitted under the bylaws may not alter or
repeal the amendment provisions of the bylaws or the provisions of the bylaws related to indemnification of our directors and officers, in either case, without the approval of the board of directors. </FONT></P>

Maryland Business Combination Act  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the MGCL, certain "business combinations" (including certain issuances of equity securities) between a Maryland corporation and any person
who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock, or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who beneficially owned ten percent or more
of the voting power at any time within the preceding two years, in each case referred to as an "interested stockholder," or an affiliate thereof, are prohibited for five years after the most recent
date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Thereafter, any such business combination must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes unless, among other
conditions, the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price (as defined in the MGCL) for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by
the interested stockholder for its shares of common stock. The business combination provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of
directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These provisions of the MGCL may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our
company that might involve a premium price for our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock, or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. </FONT></P>

Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MGCL provides that holders of "control shares" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a "control share acquisition" have no voting rights
except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers of the corporation or by employees
who are directors of the corporation. "Control shares" are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other such shares of stock previously acquired by the acquiror or in respect of which
the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within
one of the following ranges of voting power: (1)&nbsp;one-tenth or more but less than one-third, (2)&nbsp;one-third or more but less than a majority, or (3)&nbsp;a majority or more of all voting
power. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A "control share acquisition" means the
acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions (including an undertaking to pay expenses), may compel the board of
directors of the corporation to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50&nbsp;days of demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. If no request for a meeting is made, the
corporation may itself present the question at any stockholders meeting. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the statute, then, subject to certain conditions
and limitations, the corporation may redeem for fair value any and all of the control shares (except those for which voting rights have previously been approved). Fair value is determined, without
regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquiror or, if a meeting of stockholders is held at which the voting rights
of such shares are considered and not approved, as of the date of the meeting. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a
majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights, meaning that they may require us to repurchase their shares for their appraised value as determined
pursuant to the MGCL. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of such appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquiror in the control share
acquisition. </FONT></P>

permitted by the MGCL, our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share acquisition statute. That bylaw provision states that the control share statute shall not
apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of our stock. Our board of directors may, without the consent of any of our stockholders, amend or eliminate this bylaw provision at any time, which
means that we would then become subject to the Maryland control share acquisition statute, and there can be no assurance that such provision will not be amended or eliminated by our board of directors
at any time in the future. </FONT></P>

to remove a director without stockholder approval. Through provisions in our charter and bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we (1)&nbsp;vest in our board of directors the exclusive power to fix the
number of directors and (2)&nbsp;require, unless called by our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president or our board of directors, the request of stockholders entitled to cast not less
than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting to call a special meeting of stockholders. The provisions of Subtitle 8 expressly provide that Subtitle 8 does not limit the power
of a Maryland corporation, by provision in its charter, to confer on the holders of any class or series of preferred stock the right to elect one or more directors or designate the terms and voting
powers of directors, which may vary among directors. </FONT></P>

Effect of Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and our Charter and Bylaws  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock intended to, among other purposes, assist us in maintaining our status
as a REIT for United States federal and/or state income tax purposes. For example, our charter restricts any person or entity from acquiring actual or constructive ownership of more than 9.8% (by
value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of common stock. See "Restrictions on Ownership and Transfers of Stock." These restrictions could delay or
prevent a tender offer or change in control of our company or reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt such a transaction, even if a tender offer or a change of control were in our
stockholders' interests or involved a premium price for our common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock of the company, including convertible preferred stock, without stockholder approval. The board of directors may
establish the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of
any class or series of preferred stock we may issue, which may include voting rights and rights to convert such preferred stock into common stock. See "General Description of Preferred Stock." The
issuance of preferred stock could delay or prevent a tender offer or change in control of our company or reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt such a transaction, even if a tender
offer or a change of control were in our stockholders' interests or involved a premium price for our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock, which could adversely affect the market

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
charter and bylaws also provide that the number of directors may be established only by our board of directors, which prevents our stockholders from increasing the number of our
directors and filling any vacancies created by such increase with their own nominees. The provisions of our bylaws discussed above under the captions "&#151;Special Meetings of Stockholders"
and "&#151;Advance Notice of Director Nomination and New Business" require stockholders seeking to call a special meeting, nominate an individual for election as a director or propose other
business at an annual or special meeting to comply with certain notice and information requirements. These provisions, alone or in combination, could make it more difficult for our stockholders to
remove
incumbent directors or fill vacancies on our board of directors with their own nominees and could delay or prevent a proxy contest, tender offer or change in control of our company or reduce the
possibility that a third party will attempt such a contest or transaction, even if a proxy contest, tender offer or a change of control were in our stockholders' interests or involved a premium price

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding our election to be taxed as a REIT
and the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our capital stock or debt securities. Supplemental U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to holders of the securities offered by this
prospectus (including warrants, preferred stock and depositary shares) may be provided in the prospectus supplement or a free writing prospectus that relates to those securities or a document
incorporated by reference in the prospectus supplement. For purposes of this discussion, references to "we," "our" and "us" mean only Realty Income Corporation and do not include any of its
subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated. This discussion is for general information only and is not tax advice. The information under this caption "United States Federal Income Tax Considerations"

each case, as of the date of this prospectus. In addition, the administrative interpretations and practices of the IRS include its practices and policies as expressed in private letter rulings that
are not binding on the IRS except with respect to the particular taxpayers who requested and received those rulings. The sections of the Code and the corresponding Treasury Regulations that relate to
qualification and taxation as a REIT are highly technical and complex. The following discussion sets forth certain material aspects of the sections of the Code that govern the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of a REIT, its stockholders and the holders of its debt securities. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the
Code, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof. Potential tax reforms may result in significant changes to the rules governing U.S. federal income taxation. New legislation, Treasury
Regulations, administrative interpretations and practices and/or court decisions may significantly and adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
such qualification, or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in our capital stock or debt securities, including those described in this discussion. Moreover, the law relating to
the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT. Any such changes
could apply retroactively to transactions preceding the date of the change. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, any rulings from the IRS that we qualify as a REIT, and the statements in
this prospectus are not binding on the IRS or any court. Thus, we can provide no assurance that the tax considerations contained in this discussion will not be challenged by the IRS or will be
sustained by a court if challenged by the IRS. This summary does not discuss any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences, or any tax consequences arising under any U.S. federal tax laws other than
U.S. federal income tax laws, associated with the acquisition, ownership or disposition of our capital stock or debt securities, or our election to be taxed as a REIT. </FONT></P>

Taxation of Our Company  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections&nbsp;856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year
ended
December&nbsp;31, 1994. We believe that we have been organized
and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue to be organized and operate in this
manner. However, qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, including through actual operating results, asset
composition, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we have been organized and have operated, or will continue to be organized and operate,
in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. See "&#151;Failure to Qualify" for potential tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a REIT. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latham&nbsp;&amp;
Watkins&nbsp;LLP has acted as our tax counsel in connection with our filing of this prospectus and our election to be taxed as a REIT. Latham&nbsp;&amp;
Watkins&nbsp;LLP has rendered an opinion to us, as of the date of this prospectus, to the effect that, commencing with our taxable year ending December&nbsp;31, 1994, we have been organized and
have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and our proposed method of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. It must be emphasized that this opinion was based on various assumptions and representations as to factual matters, including representations made
by us in a factual certificate provided by one of our officers. In addition, this opinion was based upon our factual representations set forth in this prospectus. Moreover, our qualification and
taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, which are discussed below, including through actual operating results, asset composition,
distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed by Latham&nbsp;&amp; Watkins&nbsp;LLP. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our
actual results of operation for any particular taxable year have satisfied or will satisfy those requirements. Further, the anticipated U.S. federal income tax treatment described herein may be
changed, perhaps retroactively, by legislative, administrative or judicial action at any time. Latham&nbsp;&amp; Watkins&nbsp;LLP has no obligation to update its opinion subsequent to the date of such
opinion. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided
we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our
stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the "double taxation" that ordinarily results from investment in a C corporation. A C corporation is a corporation that generally is required to
pay tax at the corporate level. Double taxation means taxation once at the corporate level when income is earned and once again at the stockholder level when the income is distributed. We will,
however, be required to pay U.S. federal income tax as follows:</FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We

ownership requirements described in conditions&nbsp;(5) and (6)&nbsp;above. A description of the share ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our capital stock is contained in the
discussion in this prospectus under the heading "Restrictions on Ownership and Transfers of Stock." These restrictions, however, do not ensure that we have previously satisfied, and may not ensure
that we will, in all cases, be able to continue to satisfy, the share ownership requirements described in conditions&nbsp;(5) and (6)&nbsp;above. If we fail to satisfy these share ownership
requirements, except as provided in the next sentence, our status as a REIT will terminate. If, however, we comply with the rules contained in applicable Treasury Regulations that require us to
ascertain the actual ownership of our shares and we do not know, or would not have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence, that we failed to meet the requirement described in

is a partner in a
partnership (for purposes of this discussion, references to "partnership" include a limited liability company treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and references to "partner"
include a member in such a limited liability company), Treasury Regulations provide that the REIT will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership based on its interest
in partnership capital, subject to special rules relating to the 10% asset test described below. Also, the REIT will be deemed to be entitled to its proportionate share of the income of that entity.
The assets and gross income of the partnership retain the same character in the hands of the REIT for purposes of Section&nbsp;856 of the Code, including satisfying the gross income tests and the
asset tests. Thus, our pro rata share of the assets and items of income of any partnership or disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which we directly or indirectly own an interest
is treated as our assets and items of income for purposes of applying the requirements described in this discussion, including the gross income and asset tests described below. A brief summary of the
rules governing the U.S. federal income taxation of partnerships is set forth below in "&#151;Tax Aspects of the Subsidiary Partnerships and the Limited Liability Companies." </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
generally have control of our subsidiary partnerships and intend to operate them in a manner consistent with the requirements for our qualification as a REIT. We may from time to time
be a limited partner or non-managing member in some of our partnerships. If a partnership in which we own an interest takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our status as a REIT or
require us to pay tax, we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity. In addition, it is possible that a partnership could take an action which could cause us to fail a gross income or
asset test, and that we would not become aware of such action in time to dispose of our interest in the partnership or take other corrective action on a timely basis. In such a case, we could fail to
qualify as a REIT unless we were entitled to relief, as described below. </FONT></P>

purposes under the Code, including all REIT qualification tests. Thus, in applying the U.S. federal income tax requirements described in this discussion, any qualified REIT subsidiaries we own are
ignored, and all assets, liabilities and items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of such corporations are treated as our assets, liabilities and items of income, gain, loss, deduction and

may acquire securities
in additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. A taxable REIT subsidiary is a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) other than a REIT in
which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a taxable REIT subsidiary owns more than 35% of the
total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Other than some activities relating to
lodging and health care facilities, a taxable REIT subsidiary may generally engage in any business, including the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent REIT. A
taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular C corporation. A REIT's ownership of securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset test
described below. See "&#151;Asset Tests." For taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017, taxpayers are subject to a limitation on their ability to deduct net business interest
generally equal to 30% of adjusted taxable income, subject to certain exceptions. See "&#151;Annual Distribution Requirements." While not certain, this provision may limit the ability of our
taxable REIT subsidiaries to deduct interest, which could increase their taxable income. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income Tests.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must satisfy two gross income requirements annually to maintain our qualification as a REIT. First, in each
taxable year we must
derive directly or indirectly at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, certain hedging transactions and certain foreign currency gains) from investments
relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including "rents from real property," dividends from other REITs and, in certain circumstances, interest, or certain types of temporary
investments. Second, in each taxable year we must derive at least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, certain hedging transactions, and certain foreign
currency gains) from the real property investments described above or dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, or from any combination of the foregoing. For
these purposes, the term "interest" generally does not include any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, if the determination of all or some of the amount depends in any way on the
income or profits of any person. However, an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term "interest" solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of
receipts or sales. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rents

the total value of all classes of stock of the tenant. Rents we receive from such a tenant that is a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours, however, will not be excluded from the definition of "rents from
real property" as a result of this condition if at least 90% of the space at the property to which the rents relate is leased to third parties, and the rents paid by the taxable REIT subsidiary are
substantially comparable to rents paid by our other tenants for comparable space. Whether rents paid by a taxable REIT subsidiary are substantially comparable to rents paid by other tenants is
determined at the time the lease with the taxable REIT subsidiary is entered into, extended, and modified, if such modification increases the rents due under such lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
however, if a lease with a "controlled taxable REIT subsidiary" is modified and such modification results in an increase in the rents payable by such taxable REIT subsidiary, any such increase will
not qualify as "rents from real property." For purposes of this rule, a "controlled taxable REIT subsidiary" is a taxable REIT subsidiary in which the parent REIT owns stock possessing more than 50%

except as provided below. We may, however, perform services that are "usually or customarily rendered" in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise considered
"rendered to the occupant" of the property. Examples of these services include the provision of light, heat, or other utilities, trash removal and general maintenance of common areas. In addition, we
may employ an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue to provide customary services to our tenants, or a taxable REIT subsidiary (which may be wholly or partially owned by us) to provide
both customary and non-customary services to our tenants without causing the rent we receive from those tenants to fail to qualify as "rents from real property." </FONT></DD></DL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
generally do not intend to take actions we believe will cause us to fail to satisfy the rental conditions described above. However, we may intentionally fail to satisfy some of these
conditions to the extent we determine, based on the advice of our tax counsel, that the failure will not jeopardize our tax status as a REIT. In addition, with respect to the limitation on the rental
of personal property, we generally have not obtained appraisals of the real property and personal property leased to tenants. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not disagree with
our determinations of value. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From

clearly identified as a hedging transaction as specified in the Code will not constitute gross income under, and thus will be exempt from, the 75% and 95% gross income tests. The term "hedging
transaction," as used above, generally means (A)&nbsp;any transaction we enter into in the normal course of our business primarily to manage risk of (1)&nbsp;interest rate changes or fluctuations
with respect to borrowings made or to be made by us to acquire or carry real estate assets, or (2)&nbsp;currency fluctuations with respect to an item of </FONT></P>

transactions as hedges or we hedge with other types of financial instruments, the income from those transactions is not likely to be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the gross income
tests. We intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a REIT. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
time to time we may own properties or entities located outside the United States. These acquisitions could cause us to incur foreign currency gains or losses. Any foreign currency
gains, to the extent attributable to specified items of qualifying income or gain, or specified qualifying assets, however, generally will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% and 95%
gross income tests, and therefore will be excluded from these tests. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the extent our taxable REIT subsidiaries pay dividends or interest, our allocable share of such dividend or interest income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
will monitor the amount of the dividend and other income from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and will take actions intended to keep this income, and any other nonqualifying income,
within the limitations of the gross income tests. Although we expect these actions will be sufficient to prevent a violation of the gross income tests, we cannot guarantee that such actions will in
all cases prevent such a violation. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is not possible, however, to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. For example, if we fail to satisfy the gross income
tests because nonqualifying income that we intentionally accrue or receive exceeds the limits on nonqualifying income, the IRS could conclude that our failure to satisfy the tests was not due to
reasonable cause. If these relief provisions do not apply to a particular set of circumstances, we will not qualify as a REIT. See "&#151;Failure to Qualify" below. As discussed above
in&#151;General," even if these relief provisions apply, and we retain our status as a REIT, a tax would be imposed with respect to our nonqualifying income. We may not always be able to comply

will be subject to a
100% penalty tax. In general, redetermined rents are
rents from real property that are overstated as a result of any services furnished to any of our tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours, redetermined deductions and excess interest represent any
amounts that are deducted by a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on arm's length negotiations, and
redetermined TRS service income is income of a taxable REIT subsidiary that is understated as a result of services provided to us or on our behalf. Rents we receive will not constitute redetermined

do not believe we have been, and do not expect to be, subject to this penalty tax, although any rental or service arrangements we enter into from time to time may not satisfy the
safe-harbor provisions described above. These determinations are inherently factual, and the IRS has broad discretion to assert that amounts paid between related parties should be reallocated to
clearly reflect their respective incomes. If the IRS successfully made such an assertion, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any overstated rents paid to us, or any excess deductions or

nature and diversification
of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash items and U.S. government securities. For purposes of this test, the term
"real estate assets" generally means real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property or on both real property and, to a limited extent, personal
property), shares (or transferable certificates of beneficial interest) in other REITs, any stock or debt instrument attributable to the investment of the proceeds of a stock offering or a public
offering of debt with a term of at least five years (but only for the one-year period beginning on the date the REIT receives such proceeds), debt instruments of publicly offered REITs, and personal
property leased in connection with a lease of real property for which the rent attributable to personal property is not greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second,

we may own securities (including debt securities) of issuers that do not qualify as a REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary or a taxable REIT subsidiary. We intend that our ownership of any such
securities will be structured in a manner that allows us to comply with the asset tests described above. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth,
not more than 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July&nbsp;30, 2008 and before January&nbsp;1, 2018) of the value of our total assets may be represented by the
securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We currently own 100% of the stock of certain corporations that have elected, together with us, to be treated as our taxable REIT subsidiaries, and
we may acquire securities in additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. So long as each of these companies qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours, we will not be subject to the 5%
asset test, the 10% voting securities limitation or the 10% value limitation with respect to our ownership of the securities of such companies. We believe that the aggregate value of our taxable REIT
subsidiaries has not exceeded, and in the future will not exceed, 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July&nbsp;30, 2008 and before January&nbsp;1, 2018) of the aggregate value of our gross
assets. We generally do not obtain independent appraisals to support these conclusions. In addition, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not disagree with our determinations of value. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth,
not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by debt instruments of publicly offered REITs to the extent those debt instruments would not be real estate
assets but for the inclusion of debt instruments of publicly offered REITs in the meaning of real estate assets, as described above (e.g.,&nbsp;a debt instrument issued by a publicly offered REIT
that is not secured by a mortgage on real property). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
asset tests must be satisfied at the close of each calendar quarter of our taxable year in which we (directly or through our qualified REIT subsidiaries or partnerships) acquire
securities in the applicable issuer, and also at the close of each calendar quarter in which we increase our ownership of securities of such issuer (including as a result of an increase in our
interest in any partnership that owns such securities). For example, our indirect ownership of securities of each issuer may increase as a result of our capital contributions to, or the redemption of
other partners' interests in, a partnership in which we have an ownership interest. Also, after initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter, we will not lose our status as a REIT for
failure to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values. If we fail to satisfy an asset test because we acquire securities or other property during
a quarter (including as a result of an increase in our interest in any partnership), we may cure this failure by disposing of sufficient nonqualifying assets within 30&nbsp;days after the close of
that quarter. We believe that we have maintained, and we intend to maintain, adequate records of the value of our assets to ensure compliance with the asset tests. If we fail to cure any noncompliance
with the asset tests within the 30-day cure period, we would cease to qualify as a REIT unless we are eligible for certain relief provisions discussed below. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
relief provisions may be available to us if we discover a failure to satisfy the asset tests described above after the 30-day cure period. Under these provisions, we will be
deemed to have met the 5% and 10% asset tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets (i)&nbsp;does not exceed the lesser of (a)&nbsp;1% of the total value of our assets at the end of the
applicable quarter or (b)&nbsp;$10,000,000, and (ii)&nbsp;we dispose of the nonqualifying assets or otherwise satisfy such tests within (a)&nbsp;six months after the last day of the quarter in
which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered or (b)&nbsp;the period of time prescribed by Treasury Regulations to be issued. For violations of any of the asset tests due to reasonable
cause and not due to willful neglect and that are, in the case of the 5% and 10% asset tests, in excess of the de minimis exception described above, we may avoid disqualification as a REIT after the
30-day cure period by taking steps including (i)&nbsp;the disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets, or the taking of other actions, which allow us to meet the asset tests within (a)&nbsp;six
months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered or (b)&nbsp;the period of time </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
these purposes, our REIT taxable income is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain. In addition, for purposes of this test, non-cash income
generally means income attributable to leveled stepped rents, original issue discount, cancellation of indebtedness, or a like-kind exchange that is later determined to be taxable. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, our REIT taxable income will be reduced by any taxes we are required to pay on any gain we recognize from the disposition of any asset we acquired from a corporation that is
or has been a C corporation in a transaction in which our tax basis in the asset is less than the fair market value of the asset, in each case determined as of the date on which we acquired the asset,
within the five-year period following our acquisition of such asset, as described above under "&#151;General." </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017, and except as provided below, our deduction for net business interest expense will generally be limited to 30% of our taxable
income, as adjusted for certain items of income, gain, deduction or loss. Any business interest deduction that is disallowed due to this limitation may be carried forward to future taxable years. If
we are subject to this interest expense limitation, our REIT taxable income for a taxable year may be increased. Taxpayers that conduct certain real estate businesses may elect not to have this
interest expense limitation apply to them, provided that they use an alternative depreciation system to depreciate certain property. We believe that we will be eligible to make this election. If we
make this election, although we would not be subject to the interest expense limitation described above, our depreciation deductions may be reduced and, as a result, our REIT taxable income for a
taxable year may be increased. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
generally must pay, or be treated as paying, the distributions described above in the taxable year to which they relate. At our election, a distribution will be treated as paid in a
taxable year if it is declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration, provided such payment is made during
the 12-month period following the close of such year. These distributions are treated as received by our stockholders in the year in which they are paid. This is so even though these distributions
relate to the prior year for purposes of the 90% distribution requirement. In order to be taken into account for purposes of our distribution requirement, except as provided below, the amount
distributed must not be preferential&#151;i.e.,&nbsp;every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class,
and no class of stock may be treated other than according to its dividend rights as a class. This preferential limitation will not apply to distributions made by us, provided we qualify as a "publicly

be, a "publicly offered REIT." To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain, or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our REIT taxable income, as adjusted, we will
be required to pay regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on the undistributed amount. We believe that we have made, and we intend to continue to make, timely distributions sufficient to satisfy
these annual distribution requirements and to minimize our corporate tax obligations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect that our REIT taxable income will be less than our cash flow because of depreciation and other non-cash charges included in computing REIT taxable income. Accordingly, we
anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirements described above. However, from time to time, we may not have sufficient
cash or other liquid assets to meet these distribution requirements due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, and the inclusion of
income and deduction of expenses in determining our taxable income. In addition, we may decide to retain our cash, rather than distribute it, in order to repay debt or for other reasons. If these
timing differences occur, we may borrow funds to pay dividends or pay dividends in the form of taxable stock distributions in order to meet the distribution requirements, while preserving our cash. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
some circumstances, we may be able to rectify an inadvertent failure to meet the 90% distribution requirement for a year by paying "deficiency dividends" to our stockholders in a
later year, which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. In that case, we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, subject to
the 4% excise tax described below. However, we will be required to pay interest to the IRS based upon the amount of any deduction claimed for deficiency dividends. While the payment of a deficiency
dividend will apply to a prior year for purposes of our REIT distribution requirements, it will be treated as an additional distribution to our stockholders in the year such dividend is paid. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
we will be required to pay a 4% excise tax to the extent we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for such year, 95% of
our capital gain net income for the year and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods. Any ordinary income and net capital gain on which corporate income tax is imposed for any year is
treated as an amount distributed during that year for purposes of calculating this excise tax. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of the 90% distribution requirement and excise tax described above, dividends declared during the last three months of the taxable year, payable to stockholders of record on
a specified date during such period and paid during January of the following year, will be treated as paid by us and received by our stockholders on December&nbsp;31 of the year in which they are
declared. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like-Kind Exchanges.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may dispose of real property that is not held primarily for sale in transactions intended to qualify as
like-kind exchanges
under the Code. Such like-kind exchanges are intended to result in the deferral of gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The failure of any such transaction to qualify as a like-kind exchange
could require us to pay U.S. federal income tax, possibly including the 100% prohibited transaction tax, or deficiency dividends, depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular
transaction. </FONT></P>

entities and, in
connection with such acquisitions, we may succeed to the historical tax attributes and liabilities of such entities. For example, if we acquire a C corporation and subsequently dispose of its assets
within five years of the acquisition, we could be required to pay the built-in gain tax described above under "&#151;General." In addition, in order to qualify as a REIT, at the end of any
taxable year, we must not have any earnings and profits accumulated in a non-REIT year. As a result, if we acquire a C corporation, we must distribute the corporation's earnings and profits
accumulated prior to the acquisition before the end of the taxable year in which we acquire the corporation. We also could be required to pay the acquired entity's unpaid taxes even though such
liabilities arose prior to the time we acquired the entity. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
we may from time to time acquire other REITs through a merger or acquisition. If any such REIT failed to qualify as a REIT for any of its taxable years, such REIT would be
liable for (and we, as the surviving corporation in the merger or acquisition, would be obligated to pay) regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on its taxable income for such taxable years. In
addition, if such REIT was a C corporation at the time of the merger or acquisition, the tax consequences described in the preceding paragraph generally would apply. If such REIT failed to qualify as
a REIT for any of its previous taxable years, but qualified as a REIT at the time of such merger or acquisition, and we acquired such REIT's assets in a transaction in which our tax basis in the
assets of such REIT is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to such REIT's tax basis in such assets, we generally would be subject to tax on the built-in gain on each asset of such REIT as
described above if we were to dispose of the asset in a taxable transaction during the five-year period following such REIT's requalification as a REIT, subject to certain exceptions. Moreover, even
if such REIT qualified as a REIT at all relevant times, we would similarly be liable for other unpaid taxes (if any) of such REIT (such as the 100% tax on gains from any sales treated as "prohibited
transactions" as described above under "&#151;Prohibited Transaction Income"). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
after our acquisition of another corporation or entity, the asset and income tests will apply to all of our assets, including the assets we acquire from such corporation or
entity, and to all of our income, including the income derived from the assets we acquire from such corporation or entity. As a result, the nature of the assets that we acquire from such corporation
or entity and the income we derive from those assets may have an effect on our tax status as a REIT. </FONT></P>

being disqualified as a
REIT as a result of receiving income that does not qualify under the gross income tests. However, in such a case, we would be subject to the U.S. federal corporate income tax on the net non-qualifying
income from the "foreclosure property," and the after-tax amount would increase the dividends we would be required to distribute to stockholders. See "&#151;Annual Distribution Requirements."
This corporate tax would not apply to income that qualifies under the REIT 75% income test. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreclosure
property treatment will end on the first day on which we enter into a lease of the applicable property that will give rise to income that does not qualify under the REIT 75%
income test, but will not end if the lease will give rise only to qualifying income under such test. Foreclosure property treatment also will end if any construction takes place on the property (other
than completion of a building or other improvement that was more than 10% complete before default became imminent). Foreclosure property treatment is generally available for an initial period of three
years and may, in certain circumstances, be extended for an additional three years. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to Qualify.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we discover a violation of a provision of the Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT,
certain specified
cure provisions may be available to us. Except with respect to violations of the gross income tests and asset tests (for which the cure provisions are described above), and provided the violation is
due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, these cure provisions generally impose a $50,000 penalty for each violation in lieu of a loss of REIT status. If we fail to satisfy the
requirements for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and the relief provisions do not apply, we will be required to pay regular U.S. federal corporate income tax, including any applicable
alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning before January&nbsp;1, 2018, on our taxable income. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be
deductible by us. As a result, we anticipate that our failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our stockholders. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a
REIT, we will not be required to distribute any amounts to our stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and
accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. In addition, non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, may be
eligible for the preferential tax </FONT></P>

Tax Aspects of the Subsidiary Partnerships and the Limited Liability Companies  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we may own, directly or indirectly, interests in various partnerships and limited liability
companies. We expect these
will be treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, entities that are treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax
purposes are "pass-through" entities which are not required to pay U.S. federal income tax. Rather, partners of such partnerships are allocated their shares of the items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit of the partnership, and are potentially required to pay tax on this income, without regard to whether they receive a distribution from the partnership. We will include in our
income our share of these partnership items for purposes of the various gross income tests, the computation of our REIT taxable income, and the REIT distribution requirements. Moreover, for purposes
of the asset tests, we will include our pro rata share of assets held by these partnerships, based on our capital interests in each such entity. See "&#151;Taxation of Our
Company&#151;Ownership of Interests in Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies and Qualified REIT Subsidiaries." A disregarded entity is not treated as a separate entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and all assets, liabilities and items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of a disregarded entity are treated as assets, liabilities and items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit of its parent that is not a disregarded entity for all purposes under the Code, including all REIT qualification tests. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entity Classification.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our interests in the subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies involve special tax
considerations, including the
possibility that the IRS might challenge the status of these entities as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For example, an entity that would otherwise be
treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes may nonetheless be taxable as a corporation if it is a "publicly traded partnership" and certain other requirements are met. A partnership
would be treated as a publicly traded partnership if its interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or a substantial equivalent thereof,
within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations. We do not anticipate that any subsidiary partnership will be treated as a publicly traded partnership that is taxable as a corporation. However,
if any such entity were treated as a corporation, it would be required to pay an entity-level tax on its income. In this situation, the character of our assets and items of gross income would change
and could prevent us from satisfying the REIT asset tests and possibly the REIT income tests. See "&#151;Taxation of Our Company&#151;Asset Tests" and
"&#151;Income Tests." This, in turn, could prevent us from qualifying as a REIT. See "&#151;Failure to Qualify" for a discussion of the effect of our failure to meet these tests. In
addition, a change in the tax status of a subsidiary treated as a partnership or disregarded entity to a corporation might be treated as a taxable event. If so, we might incur a tax liability without
any related cash payment. We believe that each of our partnerships and limited liability companies are and will continue to be treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. </FONT></P>

attributable to appreciated
or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership must be allocated in a manner so that the contributing partner is charged with the
unrealized gain or benefits from the unrealized loss associated with the property at the time of the contribution. The amount of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss generally is equal to the
difference between the fair market value or book value and the adjusted tax basis of the contributed property at the time of contribution (this difference is referred to as a book-tax difference), as
adjusted from time to time. These allocations are solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes and do not affect the book capital accounts or other economic or legal arrangements among the partners.
Some of the partnerships in which we own an interest were formed by way of contributions of appreciated property. The relevant partnership and/or limited liability company agreements require that
allocations be made in a manner consistent with Section&nbsp;704(c) of the Code. Under Section&nbsp;704(c) of the Code we could be allocated less depreciation or more gain on sale with respect to
a contributed property than the amounts that would have been allocated to us if we had instead acquired the contributed property with an initial tax basis equal to its fair market value. Such
allocations might
adversely affect our ability to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. See "&#151;Taxation of Our Company&#151;Requirements for Qualification as a REIT" and "&#151;Annual
Distribution Requirements." </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
property acquired by a subsidiary partnership in a taxable transaction will initially have a tax basis equal to its fair market value, and Section&nbsp;704(c) of the Code generally
will not apply. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partnership Audit Rules.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 changed the rules applicable to U.S. federal income tax audits of
partnerships. Under the
new rules , among other changes and subject to certain exceptions, any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and any partner's distributive share
thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, or penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected, at the partnership level. Although it is uncertain how certain aspects of these new rules
will be implemented, it is possible that they could result in partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest being required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an
audit adjustment, and we, as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and penalties even though we, as a REIT, may
not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes as a result of the related audit adjustment. The changes created by these new rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent
on the promulgation and finalization of further regulations or other guidance by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these changes
and their potential impact on their investment in our capital stock. </FONT></P>

Taxation of Taxable U.S. Holders of Our Capital Stock  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions Generally.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as dividends and,
other than with
respect to capital gain dividends and certain amounts which have previously been subject to corporate level tax, as discussed below, will be taxable to our taxable U.S. holders as ordinary income when
actually or constructively received. See "&#151;Tax Rates" below. As long as we qualify as a REIT, these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction in the case of
U.S. holders that are corporations or, except to the extent described in "&#151;Tax Rates" below, the preferential rates on qualified dividend income applicable to non-corporate U.S. holders,
including individuals. For purposes of determining whether distributions to holders of our capital stock are out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, our earnings and profits will be
allocated first to our outstanding preferred stock, if any, and then to our outstanding common stock. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the extent that we make distributions on our capital stock in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to such stock, these distributions will be treated
first as a tax-free return of capital to a U.S. holder to the extent of the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares of stock. This treatment will reduce the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in
such shares of stock by the amount of the excess of the distribution over our current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to such stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of our
current and accumulated earnings and profits and in excess of a U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares will be taxable as capital gain. Such gain will be taxable as long-term capital gain if
the shares have been held for more than one year. Dividends we declare in October, November, or December of any year and which are payable to a holder of record on a specified date in any of these
months will be treated as both paid by us and received by the holder on December&nbsp;31 of that year, provided we actually pay the dividend on or before January&nbsp;31 of the following year.
U.S. holders may not include in their own income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses. </FONT></P>

holders as a gain from the
sale or disposition of a capital asset held for more than one year, to the extent that such gain does not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year and may not exceed our dividends paid
for the taxable year, including dividends paid the following year that are treated as paid in the current year. U.S. holders that are corporations may, however, be required to treat up to 20% of
certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income. If we properly designate any portion of a dividend as a capital gain dividend, then, except as otherwise required by law, we presently intend to
allocate a portion of the total capital gain dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of our capital stock for the year to the holders of each class of </FONT></P>

determining whether any of these tests has been met, shares of our capital stock, including common stock and other equity interests in us, considered to be owned by the U.S. holder by
reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the Code, as well as shares of our capital stock actually owned by the U.S. holder, generally must be taken into account. Because the
determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of Section&nbsp;302(b) of the Code will be satisfied with respect to the U.S. holder depends upon the facts and circumstances at the time
that the determination must be made, U.S. holders are advised to consult their tax advisors to determine such tax treatment. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a redemption or repurchase of shares of our capital stock is treated as a distribution, the amount of the distribution will be measured by the amount of cash and the fair market value
of any property received. See "&#151;Distributions Generally." A U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in the redeemed or repurchased shares generally will be transferred to the holder's remaining
shares of our capital stock, if any. If a U.S. holder owns no other shares of our capital stock, under certain circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost
entirely. Proposed Treasury Regulations issued in 2009, if enacted in their current form, would affect the basis recovery
rules described above. It is not clear whether these proposed regulations will be enacted in their current form or at all. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of a redemption or repurchase of our capital stock. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax Rates.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum tax rate for non-corporate taxpayers for (1)&nbsp;long-term capital gains, including certain "capital

generally is 20% (although depending on the characteristics of the assets which produced these gains and on designations which we may make, certain capital gain dividends may be taxed at a 25% rate)
and (2)&nbsp;"qualified dividend income" generally is 20%. In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, except to the extent that
certain holding period requirements have been met and the REIT's dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations (such as its taxable REIT subsidiaries) or to income that
was subject to tax at the corporate/REIT level (for example, if the REIT distributed taxable income that it retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year). Capital gain dividends will only be
eligible for the rates described above to the extent that they are properly designated by the REIT as "capital gain dividends." U.S. holders that are corporations may be required to treat up to 20% of
some capital gain dividends as ordinary income. In addition, non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, generally may deduct up to 20% of dividends from a REIT, other than capital gain
dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income, for taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017 and before January&nbsp;1, 2026. </FONT></P>

This income or gain will be UBTI, however, to the extent a tax-exempt holder holds its shares as "debt-financed property" within the meaning of the Code. Generally, "debt-financed property" is
property the acquisition or holding of which was financed through a borrowing by the tax-exempt holder. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
tax-exempt holders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations or supplemental unemployment benefit trusts exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under
Sections&nbsp;501(c)(7), (c)(9) or (c)(17) of the Code, respectively, income from an investment in our shares will constitute UBTI unless the organization is able to properly claim a deduction for
amounts set aside or placed in reserve for specific purposes so as to offset the income generated by its investment in our shares. These prospective investors should consult their tax advisors
concerning these "set aside" and reserve requirements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the above, however, a portion of the dividends paid by a "pension-held REIT" may be treated as UBTI as to certain trusts that hold more than 10%, by value, of the
interests in the REIT. A REIT will not be a "pension-held REIT" if it is able to satisfy the "not closely held" requirement without relying on the "look-through" exception with respect to certain
trusts or if such REIT is not "predominantly held" by "qualified trusts." As a result of restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock contained in our charter, we do not expect to be classified
as a "pension-held REIT," and as a result, the tax treatment described above should be inapplicable to our holders. However, because our common stock is (and, we anticipate, will continue to be)
publicly traded, we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case. </FONT></P>

Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders of Our Capital Stock  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following discussion addresses the rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our capital
stock by non-U.S. holders. These rules are complex, and no attempt is made herein to provide more than a brief summary of such rules. Accordingly, the discussion does not address all aspects of U.S.
federal income taxation and does not address other federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences that may be relevant to a non-U.S. holder in light of its particular circumstances. We urge
non-U.S. holders to consult their tax advisors to determine the impact of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax laws and any applicable tax treaty on the acquisition, ownership
and disposition of shares of our capital stock, including any reporting requirements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions Generally.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions (including any taxable stock distributions) that are neither attributable to gains from
sales or exchanges by
us of United States real property interests, or USRPIs, nor designated by us as capital gain dividends (except as described below) will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that
they are made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Such distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be
specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the distributions
are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder
maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which such dividends are attributable). Under certain treaties, however, lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not
apply to dividends from a REIT. Certain certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied for a non-U.S. holder to be exempt from withholding under the effectively connected income
exemption. Dividends that are treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business generally will not be subject to withholding but will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis
at the regular graduated rates, in the same manner as dividends paid to U.S. holders are subject to U.S. federal income tax. Any such dividends received by a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may
also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate (applicable after deducting U.S. federal income taxes </FONT></P>

income for certain non-U.S. holders. For withholding purposes, we expect to treat all distributions as made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. However, amounts withheld may be

that is "regularly traded," as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market located in the United States is not subject to FIRPTA, and therefore, not subject to the
21% U.S. withholding tax described above, if the non-U.S. holder did not own more than 10% of such class of stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution.
Instead, such distributions generally will be treated as ordinary dividend distributions and subject to withholding in the manner described above with respect to ordinary dividends. In addition,
distributions to certain non-U.S. publicly traded shareholders that meet certain record-keeping and other requirements ("qualified shareholders") are exempt from FIRPTA, except to the extent owners of
such qualified shareholders that are not also qualified shareholders own, actually or constructively, more than 10% of our capital stock. Furthermore, distributions to "qualified foreign pension
funds" or entities all of the interests of which are held by "qualified foreign pension funds" are exempt from FIRPTA. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of
these rules. </FONT></P>

net capital gains in
respect of our capital stock should be treated with respect to non-U.S. holders as actual distributions of capital gain dividends. Under this approach, the non-U.S. holders may be able to offset as a
credit against their U.S. federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained net capital gains and to receive from the IRS a refund to the extent their
proportionate share of such tax paid by us exceeds their actual U.S. federal income tax liability. If we were to designate any portion of our net capital gain as retained net capital gain, non-U.S.
holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the taxation of such retained net capital gain. </FONT></P>

holder upon the
sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our capital stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless such stock constitutes a USRPI. In general, stock of a domestic
corporation that constitutes a "United States real property holding corporation," or USRPHC, will constitute a USRPI. We believe that we are a USRPHC. Our capital stock will not, however, constitute a
USRPI so long as we are a "domestically controlled qualified investment entity." A "domestically controlled qualified investment entity" includes a REIT in which at all times during a five-year
testing period less than 50% in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by non-United States persons, subject to certain rules. For purposes of determining whether a REIT is a "domestically
controlled qualified investment entity," a person who at all applicable times holds less than 5% of a class of stock that is "regularly traded" is treated as a United States person unless the REIT has
actual knowledge that such person is not a United States person. We believe, but cannot guarantee, that we are a "domestically controlled qualified investment entity." Because our common stock is
(and, we anticipate, will continue to be) publicly traded, no assurance can be given that we will continue to be a "domestically controlled qualified investment entity." </FONT></P>

gain from the sale or other taxable disposition of a USRPI if the non-U.S. holder (1)&nbsp;disposes of such stock within a 30-day period preceding the ex-dividend date of a distribution, any portion
of which, but for the disposition, would have been treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI and (2)&nbsp;acquires, or enters into a contract or option to acquire, or is deemed to

a non-U.S. holder does not satisfy the requirements above, such non-U.S. holder will be subject to withholding tax of 30%, subject to a reduction in or an exemption from withholding
on such interest as a result of an applicable tax treaty. To claim such entitlement, the non-U.S. holder must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form&nbsp;W-8BEN
or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable documentation) claiming a reduction in or exemption from withholding tax under the benefit of an income tax treaty between the United States and the country in which
the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
interest paid to a non-U.S. holder is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder's conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which such interest is attributable), the non-U.S. holder will be exempt from the U.S. federal
withholding tax described above. To claim the exemption, the non-U.S. holder must furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid IRS Form&nbsp;W-8ECI, certifying that interest paid on a debt
security is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the United States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
such effectively connected interest generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular graduated rates. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also be subject
to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected interest, as adjusted for certain items. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. holders that do not
timely provide the applicable withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts
withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax
treaty. </FONT></P>

Additional Withholding Tax on Payments Made to Foreign Accounts  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withholding taxes may be imposed under Sections&nbsp;1471 to 1474 of the Code (such sections commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act, or FATCA) on certain types of payments made to non-U.S. financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on dividends on
our capital stock, interest on our debt securities, or gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our capital stock or debt securities, in each case paid to a "foreign financial institution"
or a "non-financial foreign entity" (each as defined in the Code), unless (1)&nbsp;the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations, (2)&nbsp;the
non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any "substantial United States owners" (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United
States owner, or (3)&nbsp;the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and
is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements in clause&nbsp;(1) above, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring, among other things, that it
undertake to identify accounts held by certain "specified United States persons" or "United States owned foreign entities" (each as defined in the Code), annually report certain information about such
accounts, and withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an
intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of dividends on our capital stock or interest on our debt
securities, and will apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such stock or debt securities on or after January&nbsp;1, 2019. Because we may not know the extent to
which a distribution is a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the time it is made, for purposes of these withholding rules we may treat the entire distribution as a dividend. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospective
investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding under FATCA to their investment in our capital stock or debt securities. </FONT></P>

Other Tax Consequences  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State, local and non-U.S. income tax laws may differ substantially from the corresponding U.S. federal income tax laws, and this discussion does
not purport to describe any aspect of the tax laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction, or any U.S. federal tax other than the income tax. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the
effect of state, local and non-U.S. tax
laws with respect to our tax treatment as a REIT and on an investment in our capital stock or debt securities. </FONT></P>
