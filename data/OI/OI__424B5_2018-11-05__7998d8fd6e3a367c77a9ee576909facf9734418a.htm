<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prospectus supplement describes our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan provides a convenient and economical
way for our stockholders and other investors to purchase shares of our common stock and to reinvest cash dividends in additional shares of our common stock. You should read this prospectus supplement
carefully before you invest and retain it for future reference. This prospectus supplement relates to 11,789,564 shares of our common stock registered for sale under the Plan. We currently pay regular
monthly distributions to holders of our common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "O." On November&nbsp;2, 2018, the last reported sale price of our common stock
on the New York Stock Exchange was $60.26 per share. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation
in the Plan is entirely voluntary and you may discontinue your participation at any time. </FONT></P>

Purpose    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of the Plan is to provide our common stockholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method of
purchasing our common stock. Once enrolled in the Plan, you may reinvest cash dividends and, through optional cash payments, purchase additional shares of our common stock at regular intervals.
Although we expect the Plan to appeal to many stockholders, it is entirely optional. If you are a stockholder and do not participate in the Plan, you will receive cash dividends and distributions in
the usual manner, as and when we declare and pay them. A secondary purpose of the Plan is to enable us to raise additional capital by selling newly issued shares of our common stock under the Plan. </FONT></P>

stock at any time by
using the Plan's optional cash investment feature. Optional cash investments may not be less than $100 and not more than $50,000 per month, unless we agree to waive that limit in any month. Dividend
amounts reinvested in additional shares and stock certificates deposited in the Plan for safekeeping do not count toward the $50,000 per month limit. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are not already a Plan participant at the time you wish to make an optional cash investment, you must enroll in the Plan in connection with that investment by submitting an
Initial Enrollment Form (for new investors). Your initial cash investment must be at least $1,500, which you may satisfy by authorizing a minimum of fifteen (15)&nbsp;automatic monthly investments
of at least $100, and may not exceed $50,000 unless we agree to waive that limit. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An
optional cash investment in excess of $50,000 initially or per month may only be made after submission to us of a written request for a waiver, and after we have given our written
approval, which we may grant or deny in our sole discretion. See the discussion below under the caption "Optional Investments in Excess of Plan Limits." </FONT></P>

are invested in shares
of our common stock weekly, typically on Friday or, if such day is not a business day, on the next business day (each of which is an "investment date" for optional cash investments) or as soon as
practicable thereafter. Depending on the number of shares being purchased and current trading volume in the shares, purchases may be executed in multiple transactions and may be traded on more than
one day. Shares purchased will be credited to your Plan account on each investment date or as soon as practicable thereafter. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Optional cash investments received two business
days before a given investment date will be invested on that investment date.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Optional cash payments received on or after that time will be held by the Plan Administrator until
the next investment date. We recommend that optional cash payments be sent so as to be received shortly before an investment date since no interest will be paid on cash held until an investment date. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Plan, you may elect to have monthly optional cash investments automatically deducted by electronic funds transfer from your checking or savings account at any qualified U.S.
financial institution that participates in the automated clearing house. These automatic monthly deductions are made on the 5<SUP>th</SUP>&nbsp;day of each month, the
25<SUP>th</SUP>&nbsp;day of each month or both, or if such date is not a business day, the deduction will be made on the next business day. Funds so deducted will be invested as provided in the
previous paragraph. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants
should be aware that the share price may fluctuate between the time your purchase request is received by the Plan Administrator and the time the investment is made. The Plan
Administrator may, at its own discretion, accept written requests to revoke instructions if requests are received prior to the investment being made. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment Options.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have the following three payment options when making optional cash investments. In each case, necessary
funds must be drawn in
U.S. dollars from an account with a U.S. financial institution. </FONT></P>

authorize an automatic monthly electronic funds transfer withdrawal from your U.S. financial institution checking or savings account by completing and submitting to the Plan Administrator a Direct
Debit Authorization Form with a voided blank check or deposit slip for the account from which funds are to be drawn. You may obtain a Direct Debit Authorization Form from the Plan Administrator by
calling 1-877-218-2434 (or 1-781-575-3017 outside of the United States and Canada). You may also provide the authorization online at </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>www.computershare.com/realtyincome</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Funds will be deducted from your

from us will be the
average of the high and low price per share paid on the last day on which our common stock was traded preceding the investment date as reported on the consolidated tape for New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") listed securities administered by the Consolidated Tape Association. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pricing of Shares Purchased in the Market.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For shares purchased on the open market by the Plan Administrator under the Plan,
whether through dividend
reinvestment, initial cash investment or optional cash investment, the Plan Administrator may combine your funds with funds of other Plan participants and generally will batch purchase types (dividend
reinvestments, initial cash investments and optional cash investments) for separate execution by the Plan Administrator's broker/dealer. Depending on the number of shares being purchased and current
trading volume in shares of our common stock, the Plan Administrator's broker/dealer may, in the Plan Administrator's discretion, combine and execute separate batches, execute each purchase type in
several batches throughout a trading day, and/or execute purchases for any batch or batches in multiple transactions and over more than one day. For each purchased batch, the price per share of our
common stock purchased for each Plan participant's Plan account, whether purchased with reinvested dividends, with initial cash investments or with optional cash investments, shall be the weighted
average price of the specific batch for shares of the common stock purchased by the Plan Administrator's broker/dealer on that investment date of which those shares of common stock formed a part. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
respect to any such purchases of shares of our common stock on the open market, the Plan Administrator or its broker/dealer will determine the timing, manner and terms of such
purchases. Since purchase prices for our common stock are established on the applicable investment date, a Plan participant loses any potential advantages otherwise available to such Plan participant
that arise from being able to select the timing of its investments. The Plan Administrator will have no responsibility as to the market value of shares acquired for Plan participants' accounts. </FONT></P>

Reports to Plan Participants    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you participate in the Plan, you will receive a transaction advice following each optional cash investment or sale or transfer of shares, and
will receive an account statement whenever your dividend is reinvested for any month in which your Plan account had activity showing all transactions year-to-date (shares purchased or sold, amounts
invested, amount of dividends, purchase prices) and the total number of shares in the account. In the future, we may send quarterly, semi-annual or annual statements rather than monthly statements. If
we decide to change the frequency of the account statement, we will notify you. The statement will also include specific cost basis information in accordance with applicable law. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>These statements are your continuing record of
the tax cost of your purchases of shares of our common stock under the Plan, and should be retained for income tax purposes until
such time as you have disposed of all such shares.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> You may also review your Plan account and transactions online at </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>www.computershare.com/realtyincome</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. You will also receive
copies of each prospectus and any amendments or supplements to prospectuses describing the
Plan, and copies of our annual reports to stockholders and proxy statements. You may also review these documents (except for income tax information) on our website, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>www.realtyincome.com</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, or the website

Shares so deposited in the Plan will be transferred into the name of the Plan Administrator, as custodian of your shares under the Plan, and credited to your Plan account. Thereafter, the shares will
be treated in the same manner as shares purchased through the Plan and dividends on all such deposited shares will be reinvested to the extent you elected the dividend reinvestment option.
Certificates should be unendorsed and sent to the Plan Administrator by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested and properly insured because you will bear </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depositing
your stock certificates in the Plan offers two significant advantages. First, the risk to you associated with loss, theft or destruction of stock certificates is eliminated.
If a stock certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, no transfer or sale of the shares may take place until a replacement certificate is obtained. This procedure is not always simple and usually
results in costs and paperwork to you, to us and to our transfer agent. Second, the deposited shares may be sold through the Plan in a convenient and efficient manner. </FONT></P>

system maintained by our transfer agent. Any shares remaining in your Plan account will continue to be credited to that account, and dividends paid with respect to such remaining shares will be
reinvested in additional shares in accordance with your dividend reinvestment election until your participation in the Plan is terminated. The Plan Administrator will generally process the withdrawal
of your shares as promptly as possible after your request is received. </FONT></P>

participant sale requests
for a Batch Order. Shares are then periodically submitted in bulk to a broker/dealer for sale on the open market. Shares will be sold no later than five&nbsp;business days after receipt of the
request (except where deferral is necessary under state or federal laws or regulations). Bulk sales may be executed in multiple transactions and over more than one day depending on the number of
shares being sold and current trading volumes. All sales requests in writing will be submitted as Batch Order sales. To maximize cost savings for Batch Order sale requests, the Plan Administrator will
seek to sell shares in round lot transactions. For this purpose the Plan Administrator may combine each selling Plan participant's shares with those of other selling Plan participants. In every case
of a Batch Order sale, the price to each selling Plan participant will be the weighted average sale price obtained by the Plan Administrator's broker for each aggregate order </FONT></P>

All per share
processing fees include any brokerage commissions the Plan Administrator is required to pay. All fractional shares will be rounded up to a whole share for purposes of calculating the per share
processing fee. Fees are deducted from the proceeds derived from the sale. The Plan Administrator may, under certain circumstances, require a transaction request to be submitted in writing. Please
contact the Plan Administrator to determine if there are any limitations applicable to your particular sale request. Proceeds are normally paid by check, which are distributed within 24&nbsp;hours
of after your sale transaction has settled. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan Administrator reserves the right to decline to process a sale if it determines, in its sole discretion, that supporting legal documentation is required. Instructions sent to the
Plan Administrator to sell shares are binding and may not be rescinded. In addition, no one will have any authority or power to direct the time or price at which shares for the Plan are sold, except
for prices specified for Day Limit Orders or GTC Limit Orders, and no one, other than the Plan Administrator, will select the broker/dealer(s) through or from whom sales are made. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan
participants should be aware that the price of our shares of our common stock may rise or fall during the period between a request for sale, its receipt by the Plan Administrator,
and the ultimate sale on the open market. Instructions for a Market Order or a Batch Order are binding and may not be rescinded. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a Plan participant elects to sell shares online at </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>www.computershare.com/realtyincome</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, he or she may utilize the Plan Administrator's
international currency exchange service to convert sale proceeds to local currency prior to being sent to the Plan participant. Receiving your sales proceeds in a local currency and having a check
drawn on a local bank avoids the time consuming and costly "collection" process required for cashing U.S. dollar checks. This service is subject to additional terms and conditions and fees, which a
Plan participant must agree to online. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you want to sell shares through your own broker/dealer, you may request your broker/dealer transfer your shares in your Plan account in book-entry form through the direct registration
system maintained by our transfer agent to your account with your broker/dealer. </FONT></P>

Basis of Shares Sold    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absent an election to the contrary from you, the Plan Administrator intends to use the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method when determining the
tax basis of any shares of our common stock acquired by or for you under the Plan. Under this method, the shares sold or transferred are charged against the earliest lot purchased or acquired by or
for you to determine the basis of the shares. In the alternative, investors may designate their preference of "specific identification" cost basis or the "average basis method" at any time. Such
designation must be in writing to the Plan Administrator. An investor who participates in a "dividend reinvestment plan" (or "DRP") may use the "average basis method" when determining the tax basis of
any shares they hold in the DRP. We believe and intend to take the position that the Plan qualifies as a DRP. Under this method, after you notify the Plan Administrator of your election to use the
average basis method, all sales or other dispositions of shares of our common stock that you hold in the Plan that were acquired on or after January&nbsp;1, 2012 would generally have a single basis,
which would be determined by averaging the basis of all shares acquired through </FONT></P>

Gifts and Other Transfers of Shares    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan participants may transfer ownership of some or all of their shares held through the Plan by calling the Plan Administrator at
1-877-218-2434 (or 1-781-575-3017 outside of the United&nbsp;States and Canada) for complete transfer instructions. Plan participants may also obtain information about transferring shares through
the Computershare Transfer Wizard at </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>www.computershare.com/transferwizard</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The Computershare Transfer Wizard will guide a Plan participant through the
transfer process, assist in completing the required transfer form, and identify other necessary documentation Plan participants may need to provide. Plan Participants will be asked to send to the Plan
Administrator written transfer instructions and to include a Medallion signature guarantee by a financial institution, which provides assurance that the individual signing is in fact the owner of the
shares in the Plan participant's Plan account. A notarized signature is not sufficient. Most banks and brokers offer Medallion signature guarantee services upon request. Any shares so transferred will
be withdrawn from your account, and your next account statement or transaction advice will reflect the number of shares withdrawn. </FONT></P>

Termination of Participation    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may terminate participation in the Plan prior to any dividend payment date by giving written notice of termination, signed by all persons
for whom the account is carried, to the Plan Administrator, by calling the Plan Administrator, contacting the Plan Administrator online at </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>www.computershare.com/realtyincome</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, or in writing by completing
the transaction form attached to each Plan statement and returning it to the Plan
Administrator's address. If the notice of termination is received by the Plan Administrator on or after record date for a dividend payment, the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, may either
pay such dividend in cash or reinvest it in shares of our common stock on behalf of the terminating Plan participant. If such dividend is reinvested, the Plan Administrator may sell the shares
purchased and remit the proceeds to the Plan participant, less any service fees, processing fees and any other costs of sale. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
termination of participation in the Plan, unless you have requested on the Plan termination notice that the Plan Administrator sell some or all of your shares, the Plan
Administrator will send you a direct registration statement representing the number of full shares held in your name and a check in the amount of the market value of any fractional share, less any
service fees, processing fees and any other costs of sale. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally,
you may elect to re-enroll in the Plan at any time, simply by following the same procedures used to enroll initially. However, the Plan Administrator may reject your
Enrollment Form if we believe that you have enrolled in the Plan and withdrawn too often. In addition, we may withdraw you from the Plan if your Plan account is less than one whole share as a result
of withdrawals or sales of stock and you are not reinvesting dividends or distributions from any stock registered in your name. We would take these actions because we intend to minimize unnecessary
administrative expense and to encourage use of the Plan as a long-term stockholder investment service. </FONT></P>

Tax Considerations for U.S. Participants  </B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions a U.S. Participant receives on shares of our common stock the participant holds in the Plan and that are reinvested in additional
shares will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as taxable stock distributions to the participant. Accordingly, to the extent we have current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Participant will receive taxable dividend income. The amount of any distribution a U.S. Participant will be treated as having received depends, in part, on the
facts existing at the time of the distribution. Assuming the participation and transaction fees charged to U.S. Participants are sufficient to pay any brokerage commissions in connection with any
shares of common stock purchased through the Plan, we expect the amount of the distribution to be equal to the amount of the cash dividend the participant could have received if the participant had
not elected to reinvest that cash pursuant to the Plan. The U.S. federal income tax consequences of making optional cash purchases of shares through the plan are not entirely clear. The IRS may take
the position that the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the common shares acquired on the purchase date over the amount of the cash payment is treated as a distribution to a U.S.
Participant, particularly if the participant also participates in the dividend reinvestment portion of the plan. You should consult your tax advisor to determine how to treat any such discount for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. For a discussion of the tax treatment of our distributions, see the accompanying prospectus under the heading "United States Federal Income Tax
Considerations&#151;Taxation of Taxable U.S. Holders of Our Capital Stock." You will receive an IRS Form&nbsp;1099-DIV after the end of the year which will show for the year your total
dividend income, your amount of any return of capital distribution and your amount of any capital gain dividend. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
IRS has held in certain private letter rulings that brokerage commissions paid by a corporation with respect to open market purchases on behalf of participants in a dividend
reinvestment plan or pursuant to the optional cash purchase features of a plan were to be treated as constructive distributions to participants who were stockholders of the corporation. In these
rulings the IRS determined that the payment of these fees or commissions was subject to income tax in the same manner as distributions and includable in the participant's cost basis of the shares
purchased. Under the Plan, you are required to pay certain fees and costs associated with certain transactions and your participation in the Plan. We presently expect such amounts will be sufficient
to pay certain third party costs, such as brokerage commissions, related to purchases and sales of shares of our common stock. To the extent that we pay brokerage commissions or similar costs in
excess of the amounts paid by stockholders who are U.S. Participants with respect to any open market or privately negotiated
purchases made with reinvested dividends or optional cash purchases by the Plan Administrator, we presently intend to take the position that such participants received their proportionate amount of
the commissions or similar costs as distributions in addition to the amounts described above. We intend to take the position that administrative expenses of the Plan paid by us are not constructive
distributions to U.S. Participants. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe and intend to take the position that the Plan qualifies as a "dividend reinvestment plan" (or "DRP") (as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations). As set forth in
"Description of the Plan&#151;Basis of Shares Sold" above, absent an election to the contrary from a participant, the Plan Administrator intends to use the FIFO method when determining the tax
basis of any shares of our common stock acquired by or for participants under the Plan. Under this method, the shares sold or transferred are charged against the earliest lot purchased or acquired by
or for a participant to determine the basis of the shares. In the alternative, participants may designate their preference of "specific identification" cost basis or the "average basis method" at any
time. Such designation must be in writing to the Plan Administrator. An investor who participates in a DRP may use the "average basis </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>method"
when determining the tax basis of any shares they hold in the DRP. Under this method, after a U.S. Participant notifies the Plan Administrator of the participant's election to use the average
basis method, all sales or other dispositions of shares of our common stock that the participant holds in the Plan that were acquired on or after January&nbsp;1, 2012 would generally have a single
basis, which would be determined by averaging the basis of all shares acquired through the Plan since such date. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the extent the average basis method does not apply, a U.S. Participant's tax basis in shares of our common stock the participant acquires under the dividend reinvestment features of
the Plan generally will be equal to the total amount of distributions the participant is treated as receiving, as described above, and the participant's tax basis in shares of common stock the
participant acquires through an optional cash purchase under the Plan generally will equal the amount of the optional cash payment plus the amount of any discount or brokerage commissions treated as a
dividend. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
U.S. Participant's holding period for the shares of our common stock acquired under the Plan will begin on the day following the date such shares were purchased for the participant's
account. Consequently, shares of our common stock purchased at different times will have different holding periods. </FONT></P>

U.S. Participant will not realize any gain or loss when the participant receives certificates for whole shares of our common stock credited to the participant's account, either upon
the participant's request, when the participant withdraws from the Plan or if the Plan terminates. However, a U.S. Participant will recognize gain or loss when whole shares of our common stock
acquired under the Plan are sold or
exchanged. A U.S. Participant will also recognize gain or loss when the participant receives a cash payment for a fractional share of our common stock credited to the participant's account when the
participant withdraws from the Plan or if the Plan terminates. The amount of the U.S. Participant's gain or loss will equal the difference between the amount the participant receives for the
participant's shares or fractional shares of our common stock, net of any costs of sale paid by the participant, and the participant's tax basis of such shares. For a discussion of the tax treatment
of dispositions of our common stock, see the accompanying prospectus under the heading "United States Federal Income Tax Considerations&#151;Taxation of Taxable U.S. Holders of Our Capital
Stock." </FONT></P>

prospectus is part of an automatic shelf registration statement that we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as a "well-known seasoned issuer" as
defined in Rule&nbsp;405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, using a "shelf" registration process for the delayed offering and sale of securities pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;415 under the Securities Act. Under this shelf registration process, we may, from time to time, offer and sell any of the securities, or any combination of the securities, described in
this prospectus in one or more offerings. This prospectus only provides you with a general description of the securities that we may offer. Each time we sell securities, we will provide a prospectus
supplement and may provide you with a free writing prospectus or other offering materials (collectively, "offering materials") that will contain
specific information about the securities being offered and sold and the specific terms of that offering. The prospectus supplement or other offering materials may also add, update or change
information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus. If there is any inconsistency between the information in this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement or other
offering materials, you should rely on the information in the applicable prospectus supplement or other offering materials. Before purchasing any securities, you should carefully read this prospectus,
the applicable prospectus supplement and any other offering materials we may provide you in connection with the offering of those securities, together with the documents incorporated and deemed to be
incorporated by reference in this prospectus, which incorporated documents may be obtained as described under the headings "Where You Can Find More Information" and "Incorporation by Reference." </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
allowed by SEC rules, this prospectus does not contain all the information you can find in the registration statement or the exhibits to the registration statement. For further
information, we refer you to the registration statement, including its exhibits and any schedules. Statements contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus about the provisions or contents
of any contract, agreement or any other document referred to are not complete. For each of these contracts, agreements or documents filed as an exhibit to the registration statement or a document
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in this prospectus, we refer you to the actual exhibit for a complete description of the matters involved, and any statements contained or
incorporated by reference in this prospectus or any prospectus supplement or any other offering materials we may provide you regarding those contracts, agreements or other documents are subject to,
and qualified in their entirety by reference to, the complete terms of those documents. You should rely only on the information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and in any
supplement to this prospectus and, if applicable, any other offering materials we may provide you. We have not authorized any other person to provide you with any information or to make any
representations other than those contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, any applicable prospectus supplement or any other offering materials prepared by or on behalf of us or to
which we have referred you. We take no responsibility for, and can provide no assurance as to the reliability of, any other information that others may give you. We will not offer or sell any
securities in any jurisdiction where, or to any person to whom, such offer or sale is not permitted. You should assume that the information appearing in this prospectus, the applicable prospectus
supplement and any other offering materials we may provide you in connection with an offering of securities is accurate only as of the respective dates of those documents, and that the information
appearing in any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in this prospectus or any accompanying prospectus supplement is accurate only as of the respective dates on which those
documents were filed with the SEC, in each case unless we expressly indicate otherwise. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since those dates. </FONT></P>

dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. We are structured as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, requiring us annually to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding

single-tenant properties, and the remaining were multi-tenant properties. At September&nbsp;30, 2018, of the 5,666&nbsp;single-tenant properties, 5,596&nbsp;were leased with a weighted average
remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 9.3 years. </FONT></P>

General  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prospectus describes certain general terms and provisions of our debt securities. When we offer to sell a particular series of debt
securities, we will describe the specific terms of the series in a prospectus supplement, a pricing supplement or other offering materials. We will also indicate in the supplement or other offering
materials whether the general terms and provisions described in this prospectus apply to a particular series of debt securities. Our debt securities will be our direct obligations and they may be
secured or unsecured, senior or subordinated indebtedness. We
may issue our debt securities under one or more indentures. Each indenture and the certificate or certificates evidencing the debt securities of each series will be in the form filed or incorporated
by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement containing this prospectus, a post-effective amendment to the registration statement or a document incorporated by reference herein and may be
obtained as described below under "Where You Can Find More Information." The form of indenture is subject to any amendments or supplements that may be adopted from time to time. We will enter into
each indenture with a trustee and the trustee for each indenture may be the same. Each indenture will be subject to, and governed by, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Unless otherwise
expressly stated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will be issued under an indenture dated as of October&nbsp;28, 1998 between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, N.A., as successor trustee, a copy of which has been incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement containing this prospectus. Because this description of debt
securities is a summary, it does not contain all the information that may be important to you and this description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the form of the
applicable indenture and the certificate evidencing the debt securities of the applicable series. You should read the applicable indenture and the form of certificate evidencing the applicable debt
securities in their entirety to assure that you have all the important information you need to make any required decisions. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, all
references to the "Company," "Realty Income," "our," "we" and "us" and all similar references appearing under this caption "Description of Debt Securities" mean Realty Income Corporation, a Maryland
corporation, excluding its subsidiaries. All other capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this section shall have the meanings set forth in the applicable indenture. </FONT></P>

Terms  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular terms of any series of our debt securities will be described in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials.
Additionally, any applicable modifications of or additions to the general terms of our debt securities, described in this prospectus and in the applicable indenture, will also be described in a
prospectus supplement or other offering materials. Accordingly, for a description of the terms of any series of our debt securities, you must refer to both the prospectus supplement or other offering
materials, if any, relating to those debt securities and the description of the debt securities set forth in this prospectus. If any particular terms of our debt securities, described in a prospectus
supplement or other offering materials, differ from any of the terms described in this prospectus, then those terms as set forth in the relevant prospectus supplement or other offering materials will
control. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
as set forth in any prospectus supplement or other offering materials, our debt securities may be issued without limit as to aggregate principal amount, in one or more series, in
each case as established from time to time by our board of directors, a committee of the board of directors or as set forth in the applicable indenture or one or more supplements to that indenture.
All of our debt securities of one series need not be issued at the same time, and unless otherwise provided, a series may be reopened for issuance of additional debt securities without the consent of
the holders of the debt securities of that series. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
indenture will provide that we may, but need not, designate more than one trustee for the indenture, each with respect to one or more series of our debt securities. Any trustee
under an indenture may resign or be removed with respect to one or more series of our debt securities, and a successor trustee may be appointed to act with respect to that series. If two or more
persons are acting as trustee to different series of our debt securities, each trustee shall be a trustee of a trust under the applicable indenture separate and apart from the trust administered by
any other trustee and, except as otherwise indicated in this prospectus, any action taken by a trustee may be taken by that trustee with respect to, and only with respect to, the one or more series of
debt securities for which it is trustee under the applicable indenture. </FONT></P>

Terms  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the preferential rights of any other class or series of our stock and to the provisions of our charter regarding the restrictions on
ownership and transfer of stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of assets legally available
therefor. The terms of any preferred stock we may issue in the future may provide for restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends on, and the purchase of, our common stock and may also
provide for holders of that class or series of preferred stock to receive preferential distributions in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up before any payments may be made on our
common stock. For additional information, see "General Description of Preferred Stock" in this prospectus and, if applicable, the articles supplementary classifying and designating shares of any class
or series of preferred stock we may subsequently issue, which will be filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part or to a document
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in this prospectus or another document we file with the SEC, and the description of any such subsequently issued class or series of our preferred

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
charter authorizes our board of directors to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock into other classes or series of stock and to establish
the number of shares in each class or series and to set the terms, preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions,
qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption for each such class or series. Thus, the board of directors could cause the issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend rights, rights to
distributions in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voting rights or other rights that could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock or delay or prevent a
tender offer or change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interests, any of which could adversely affect the
market price of our common stock. For additional information, see "General Description of Preferred Stock" and "Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and of our Charter and Bylaws&#151;Effect of
Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and our Charter and Bylaws." </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the provisions of our charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock (see "Restrictions on Ownership and Transfers of Stock" below), each
outstanding share of our common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors (other than any directors to be elected
exclusively by holders of our outstanding preferred stock or any other class or series of our stock) and, except as provided with respect to any other class or series of stock, the holders of shares
of our common stock will possess the exclusive voting power. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holders
of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, which means that holders of more than 50% of all the shares of our common stock voting for
the election of directors can elect all the directors standing for election (other than any directors to be elected exclusively by holders of our outstanding preferred stock or any other class or
series of our stock) at the time if they choose to do so, and the holders of the remaining shares of our common stock cannot elect any such directors. All of our directors currently serve a one year
term. Holders of shares of common stock do not have preemptive rights, which means they have no right under the charter, bylaws, or Maryland law to acquire any additional shares of common stock that
may be issued by us at a subsequent date. Holders of shares of common stock have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund or redemption rights. Under Maryland law, stockholders generally are
not liable for the corporation's debts or obligations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, convert into another entity, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a share
exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business unless approved by its stockholders by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the
matter unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation's charter. Our charter provides that any such
action shall be effective if approved by the
affirmative vote of holders of shares entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Because the term "substantially all" of a company's assets is not defined in the
MGCL, it is subject to Maryland common law and to judicial interpretation and review in the context of the unique facts and circumstances of any particular transaction. Accordingly, there may be
uncertainty as to whether a sale of "substantially all" of our assets has taken place within the meaning of the MGCL provisions described above. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us to qualify as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by or
for five or fewer individuals (defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year. To assist us in meeting this requirement and certain other requirements relating
to our tax status as a REIT, the articles supplementary establishing any class or series of preferred stock may contain provisions, which will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement or
other offering materials, intended to limit the actual, beneficial or constructive ownership by a single person or entity of our outstanding preferred stock. See "Restrictions on Ownership and
Transfers of Stock" below. </FONT></P>

Internal Revenue Code Requirements  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain our REIT status under the Code, no more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned, actually or
constructively, by or for five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year. In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our
stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of a tenant of ours (or a tenant of any partnership or limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in
which we are a partner or member), the rent received by us (either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income
tests of the Code. A REIT's stock must also be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335&nbsp;days of a taxable year of twelve months or during a proportionate part of a shorter
taxable year. </FONT></P>

Transfer Restrictions in Charter  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we expect to continue to qualify as a REIT, our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock which,
among other purposes, are intended to assist us in complying with applicable Code requirements. Our charter provides that, subject to certain specified exceptions, no person or entity may own, or be
deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of
common stock. We refer to this restriction as the "ownership limit." The constructive ownership rules of the Code are complex, and may cause shares of common stock owned actually or constructively by
a group of related individuals and/or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of the shares of common stock (or the acquisition
of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, common stock) by an individual or entity, could nevertheless cause that individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to
constructively own more than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock and thus violate the ownership limit, or any other limit as provided in our charter or as otherwise permitted by our board of
directors. Our board of directors may, but in no event is required to, exempt from the ownership limit a particular stockholder if it determines that such ownership will not jeopardize our status as a
REIT. As a condition of such exemption, the board of directors may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to it and/or undertakings or representations
from the applicant with respect to preserving our REIT status. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
charter further prohibits (1)&nbsp;any person from actually or constructively owning shares of our common stock that would result in our being "closely held" under
Section&nbsp;856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, and (2)&nbsp;any person from transferring shares of our common stock if such transfer would result in shares of
our capital stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
person who acquires or attempts to acquire actual or constructive ownership of shares of our common stock that would violate any of the foregoing restrictions on transferability and
ownership is required to give notice to us immediately and provide us with such other information as we may request in order to determine the effect of such transfer on our status as a REIT. The
foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify,
as a REIT and such determination is approved by the holders of two-thirds of all shares entitled to vote on the matter, as required by our charter. Except as otherwise described above, any change in
the ownership limit would require an amendment to the charter. </FONT></P>

Effect of Violation of Transfer Provisions  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to our charter, if any purported transfer of common stock or any other event would result in any person violating the ownership limit
or such other limit as provided in the charter, or as otherwise permitted by our board of directors, or result in our being "closely held" under Section&nbsp;856(h) of the Code, or otherwise cause
us to fail to qualify as a REIT, then the number of shares that would otherwise cause such violation or result will be transferred automatically to a trust, the beneficiary of which will be a
qualified charitable organization selected by us. Such automatic transfer shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of such violative transfer. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within
20&nbsp;days of receiving notice from us of the transfer of shares to the trust, the trustee of the trust (who shall be designated by us and be unaffiliated with us and any
prohibited transferee or prohibited owner) will be required to sell such shares to a person or entity who could own the shares without violating the ownership limit, or any other limit as provided in
our charter or as otherwise permitted by our board of directors, and distribute to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner, as applicable, an amount equal to the lesser of the price paid by the
prohibited transferee or prohibited owner for such shares or the net sales proceeds received by the trust for such shares. In the case of any event other than a transfer, or in the case of a transfer
for no consideration (such as a gift), the trustee will be required to sell such shares to a qualified person or entity and distribute to the prohibited owner an
amount equal to the lesser of the market price (determined as provided in our charter) of such shares as of the date of the event resulting in the transfer or the net sales proceeds received by the
trust for such shares. In either case, any proceeds in excess of the amount distributable to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner, as applicable, will be distributed to the beneficiary. Prior
to a sale of any such shares by the trust, the trustee will be entitled to receive, in trust for the beneficiary, all dividends and other distributions paid by us with respect to such shares, and also
will be entitled to exercise all voting rights with respect to such shares. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to Maryland law, effective as of the date that such shares have been transferred to the trust, the trustee shall have the authority (at the trustee's sole discretion)
(1)&nbsp;to rescind as void any vote cast by a prohibited transferee or prohibited owner, as applicable, prior to the discovery by us that such shares have been transferred to the trust and
(2)&nbsp;to recast such vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the beneficiary. However, if we have already taken irreversible corporate action, then the
trustee shall not have the authority to rescind and recast that vote. Any dividend or other distribution paid to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner prior to the discovery by us that such
shares had been automatically transferred to a trust as described above will be required to be repaid to the trustee upon demand for distribution to the beneficiary. In the event that the transfer to
the trust as described above is not automatically effective (for any reason) to prevent violation of the ownership limit or any other limit as provided in our charter or as otherwise permitted by our
board of directors, then our charter provides that the transfer of such shares will be void. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, shares of our common stock held in the trust shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to us, or our designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;the
price per share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the trust (or, in the case of a devise or gift, the market price at the time of such devise or gift) and (2)&nbsp;the market
price on the date we, or our designee, accept such offer. We shall have the right to accept such offer until the trustee has sold the shares of common stock held in the trust. Upon such a sale to us,
the interest of the beneficiary in the shares sold shall terminate and the trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the prohibited </FONT></P>

Election and Removal of Directors  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our charter and bylaws provide that our board of directors may establish the number of directors of our company as long as the number is not
fewer than the minimum number required under the MGCL, which is one, nor, unless our bylaws are amended, more than 15. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to our charter, each of our directors is elected by our stockholders to serve until the next annual meeting following his or her election and until his or her successor is duly
elected and qualifies. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to our bylaws, directors in uncontested elections are elected upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast for and against such nominee at a duly called
meeting of stockholders, and directors in contested elections are elected by a plurality of all of the votes cast. In both uncontested and contested elections, holders of shares of our common stock
have no right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. Consequently, at each annual meeting of stockholders, the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock will be able to elect
all of our directors. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the MGCL and our bylaws, except as otherwise provided in the terms of any class or series of our stock, vacancies on our board of directors created by any reason other than an
increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum, and any vacancy in the number of directors
created by an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire board. Any individual elected to fill a vacancy will serve until the next annual meeting of
stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
charter provides that, subject to the rights of holders of shares of one or more classes or series of preferred stock to elect or remove one or more directors, a director may be
removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. </FONT></P>

Amendment to Charter and Bylaws  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in the MGCL, amendments to our charter must be advised by our board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of our
stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our board of directors generally has the
power to amend our bylaws; provided, that, amendments to certain provisions in our bylaws related to a written statement required to be furnished to stockholders in the event of certain distributions,
our investment policy and restrictions, an annual report to stockholders and the definitions used in those sections of our bylaws must be approved by the affirmative vote of our stockholders entitled
to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Additionally, our bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast
on the matter pursuant to a binding proposal submitted for approval at any annual or special meeting of stockholders by any stockholder or group of up to five stockholders holding at least one percent
of the outstanding shares of our common stock for at least one year and who comply with the advance notice provisions in our bylaws. A stockholder proposal submitted under the bylaws may not alter or
repeal the amendment provisions of the bylaws or the provisions of the bylaws related to indemnification of our directors and officers, in either case, without the approval of the board of directors. </FONT></P>

Maryland Business Combination Act  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the MGCL, certain "business combinations" (including certain issuances of equity securities) between a Maryland corporation and any person
who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock, or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who beneficially owned ten percent or more
of the voting power at any time within the preceding two years, in each case referred to as an "interested stockholder," or an affiliate thereof, are prohibited for five years after the most recent
date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Thereafter, any such business combination must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes unless, among other
conditions, the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price (as defined in the MGCL) for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by
the interested stockholder for its shares of common stock. The business combination provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of
directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These provisions of the MGCL may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our
company that might involve a premium price for our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock, or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. </FONT></P>

Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MGCL provides that holders of "control shares" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a "control share acquisition" have no voting rights
except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers of the corporation or by employees
who are directors of the corporation. "Control shares" are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other such shares of stock previously acquired by the acquiror or in respect of which
the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within
one of the following ranges of voting power: (1)&nbsp;one-tenth or more but less than one-third, (2)&nbsp;one-third or more but less than a majority, or (3)&nbsp;a majority or more of all voting
power. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A "control share acquisition" means the
acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions (including an undertaking to pay expenses), may compel the board of
directors of the corporation to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50&nbsp;days of demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. If no request for a meeting is made, the
corporation may itself present the question at any stockholders meeting. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the statute, then, subject to certain conditions
and limitations, the corporation may redeem for fair value any and all of the control shares (except those for which voting rights have previously been approved). Fair value is determined, without
regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquiror or, if a meeting of stockholders is held at which the voting rights
of such shares are considered and not approved, as of the date of the meeting. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a
majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights, meaning that they may require us to repurchase their shares for their appraised value as determined
pursuant to the MGCL. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of such appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquiror in the control share
acquisition. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
permitted by the MGCL, our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share acquisition statute. That bylaw provision states that the control share statute shall not
apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of our stock. Our board of directors may, without the consent of any of our stockholders, amend or eliminate this bylaw provision at any time, which
means that we would then become subject to the Maryland control share acquisition statute, and there can be no assurance that such provision will not be amended or eliminated by our board of directors
at any time in the future. </FONT></P>

Effect of Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and our Charter and Bylaws  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock intended to, among other purposes, assist us in maintaining our status
as a REIT for United States federal and/or state income tax purposes. For example, our charter restricts any person or entity from acquiring actual or constructive ownership of more than 9.8% (by
value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of common stock. See "Restrictions on Ownership and Transfers of Stock." These restrictions could delay or
prevent a tender offer or change in control of our company or reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt such a transaction, even if a tender offer or a change of control were in our
stockholders' interests or involved a premium price for our common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock of the company, including convertible preferred stock, without stockholder approval. The board of directors may
establish the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of
any class or series of preferred stock we may issue, which may include voting rights and rights to convert such preferred stock into common stock. See "General Description of Preferred Stock." The
issuance of preferred stock could delay or prevent a tender offer or change in control of our company or reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt such a transaction, even if a tender
offer or a change of control were in our stockholders' interests or involved a premium price for our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock, which could adversely affect the market
price of our common stock and any such class or series of preferred stock. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
charter and bylaws also provide that the number of directors may be established only by our board of directors, which prevents our stockholders from increasing the number of our
directors and filling any vacancies created by such increase with their own nominees. The provisions of our bylaws discussed above under the captions "&#151;Special Meetings of Stockholders"
and "&#151;Advance Notice of Director Nomination and New Business" require stockholders seeking to call a special meeting, nominate an individual for election as a director or propose other
business at an annual or special meeting to comply with certain notice and information requirements. These provisions, alone or in combination, could make it more difficult for our stockholders to
remove
incumbent directors or fill vacancies on our board of directors with their own nominees and could delay or prevent a proxy contest, tender offer or change in control of our company or reduce the
possibility that a third party will attempt such a contest or transaction, even if a proxy contest, tender offer or a change of control were in our stockholders' interests or involved a premium price
for our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and any such class or series of preferred stock. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding our election to be taxed as a REIT
and the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our capital stock or debt securities. Supplemental U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to holders of the securities offered by this
prospectus (including warrants, preferred stock and depositary shares) may be provided in the prospectus supplement or a free writing prospectus that relates to those securities or a document
incorporated by reference in the prospectus supplement. For purposes of this discussion, references to "we," "our" and "us" mean only Realty Income Corporation and do not include any of its
subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated. This discussion is for general information only and is not tax advice. The information under this caption "United States Federal Income Tax Considerations"
(a)&nbsp;supersedes and replaces in its entirety the information appearing in our Form&nbsp;8-K filed with the SEC on February&nbsp;27, 2018 (including Exhibit&nbsp;99.1 thereto) and

each case, as of the date of this prospectus. In addition, the administrative interpretations and practices of the IRS include its practices and policies as expressed in private letter rulings that
are not binding on the IRS except with respect to the particular taxpayers who requested and received those rulings. The sections of the Code and the corresponding Treasury Regulations that relate to
qualification and taxation as a REIT are highly technical and complex. The following discussion sets forth certain material aspects of the sections of the Code that govern the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of a REIT, its stockholders and the holders of its debt securities. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the
Code, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof. Potential tax reforms may result in significant changes to the rules governing U.S. federal income taxation. New legislation, Treasury
Regulations, administrative interpretations and practices and/or court decisions may significantly and adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
such qualification, or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in our capital stock or debt securities, including those described in this discussion. Moreover, the law relating to
the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT. Any such changes
could apply retroactively to transactions preceding the date of the change. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, any rulings from the IRS that we qualify as a REIT, and the statements in
this prospectus are not binding on the IRS or any court. Thus, we can provide no assurance that the tax considerations contained in this discussion will not be challenged by the IRS or will be
sustained by a court if challenged by the IRS. This summary does not discuss any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences, or any tax consequences arising under any U.S. federal tax laws other than
U.S. federal income tax laws, associated with the acquisition, ownership or disposition of our capital stock or debt securities, or our election to be taxed as a REIT. </FONT></P>

Taxation of Our Company  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections&nbsp;856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year
ended
December&nbsp;31, 1994. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code commencing with such taxable year,
and we intend to continue to be organized and operate in this manner. However, qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the
Code, including through actual operating results, asset composition, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we have been organized and have
operated, or will continue to be organized and operate, in
a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. See "&#151;Failure to Qualify" for potential tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a REIT. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latham&nbsp;&amp;
Watkins&nbsp;LLP has acted as our tax counsel in connection with our filing of this prospectus and our election to be taxed as a REIT. Latham&nbsp;&amp;
Watkins&nbsp;LLP has rendered an opinion to us, as of the date of this prospectus, to the effect that, commencing with our taxable year ending December&nbsp;31, 1994, we have been organized and
have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and our proposed method of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. It must be emphasized that this opinion was based on various assumptions and representations as to factual matters, including representations made
by us in a factual certificate provided by one of our officers. In addition, this opinion was based upon our factual representations set forth in this prospectus. Moreover, our qualification and
taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, which are discussed below, including through actual operating results, asset composition,
distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed by Latham&nbsp;&amp; Watkins&nbsp;LLP. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our
actual results of operation for any particular taxable year have satisfied or will satisfy those requirements. Further, the anticipated U.S. federal income tax treatment described herein may be
changed, perhaps retroactively, by legislative, administrative or judicial action at any time. Latham&nbsp;&amp; Watkins&nbsp;LLP has no obligation to update its opinion subsequent to the date of such
opinion. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided
we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our
stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the "double taxation" that ordinarily results from investment in a C corporation. A C corporation is a corporation that generally is required to
pay tax at the corporate level. Double taxation means taxation once at the corporate level when income is earned and once again at the stockholder level when the income is distributed. We will,
however, be required to pay U.S. federal income tax as follows:</FONT></P>

that we will, in all cases, be able to continue to satisfy, the share ownership requirements described in conditions&nbsp;(5) and (6)&nbsp;above. If we fail to satisfy these share ownership
requirements, except as provided in the next sentence, our status as a REIT will terminate. If, however, we comply with the rules contained in applicable Treasury Regulations that require us to

is a partner in a
partnership (for purposes of this discussion, references to "partnership" include a limited liability company treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and references to "partner"
include a member in such a limited liability company), Treasury Regulations provide that the REIT will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership based on its interest
in partnership capital, subject to special rules relating to the 10% asset test described below. Also, the REIT will be deemed to be entitled to its proportionate share of the income of that entity.
The assets and gross income of the partnership retain the same character in the hands of the REIT for purposes of Section&nbsp;856 of the Code, including satisfying the gross income tests and the
asset tests. Thus, our pro rata share of the assets and items of income of any partnership or disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which we directly or indirectly own an interest
is treated as our assets and items of income for purposes of applying the requirements described in this discussion, including the gross income and asset tests described below. A brief summary of the
rules governing the U.S. federal income taxation of partnerships is set forth below in "&#151;Tax Aspects of the Subsidiary Partnerships and the Limited Liability Companies." </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
generally have control of our subsidiary partnerships and intend to operate them in a manner consistent with the requirements for our qualification as a REIT. We may from time to time
be a limited partner or non-managing member in some of our partnerships. If a partnership in which we own an interest takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our status as a REIT or
require us to pay tax, we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity. In addition, it is possible that a partnership could take an action which could cause us to fail a gross income or
asset test, and that we would not become aware of such action in time to dispose of our interest in the partnership or take other corrective action on a timely basis. In such a case, we could fail to
qualify as a REIT unless we were entitled to relief, as described below. </FONT></P>

may acquire securities
in additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. A taxable REIT subsidiary is a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) other than a REIT in
which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a taxable REIT subsidiary owns more than 35% of the
total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Other than some activities relating to
lodging and health care facilities, a taxable REIT subsidiary may generally engage in any business, including the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent REIT. A
taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular C corporation. A REIT's ownership of securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset test
described below. See "&#151;Asset Tests." For taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017, taxpayers are subject to a limitation on their ability to deduct net business interest
generally equal to 30% of adjusted taxable income, subject to certain exceptions. See "&#151;Annual Distribution Requirements." While not certain, this provision may limit the ability of our
taxable REIT subsidiaries to deduct interest, which could increase their taxable income. </FONT></P>

taxable year we must
derive directly or indirectly at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, certain hedging transactions and certain foreign currency gains) from investments
relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including "rents from real property," dividends from other REITs and, in certain circumstances, interest, or certain types of temporary
investments. Second, in each taxable year we must derive at least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, certain hedging transactions, and certain foreign
currency gains) from the real property investments described above or dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, or from any combination of the foregoing. For
these purposes, the term "interest" generally does not include any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, if the determination of all or some of the amount depends in any way on the
income or profits of any person. However, an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term "interest" solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of
receipts or sales. </FONT></P>

the total value of all classes of stock of the tenant. Rents we receive from such a tenant that is a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours, however, will not be excluded from the definition of "rents from

substantially comparable to rents paid by our other tenants for comparable space. Whether rents paid by a taxable REIT subsidiary are substantially comparable to rents paid by other tenants is
determined at the time the lease with the taxable REIT subsidiary is entered into, extended, and modified, if such modification increases the rents due under such lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
however, if a lease with a "controlled taxable REIT subsidiary" is modified and such modification results in an increase in the rents payable by such taxable REIT subsidiary, any such increase will

"rendered to the occupant" of the property. Examples of these services include the provision of light, heat, or other utilities, trash removal and general maintenance of common areas. In addition, we
may employ an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue to provide customary services to our tenants, or a taxable REIT subsidiary (which may be wholly or partially owned by us) to provide
both customary and non-customary services to our tenants without causing the rent we receive from those tenants to fail to qualify as "rents from real property." </FONT></DD></DL>

generally do not intend to take actions we believe will cause us to fail to satisfy the rental conditions described above. However, we may intentionally fail to satisfy some of these
conditions to the extent we determine, based on the advice of our tax counsel, that the failure will not jeopardize our tax status as a REIT. In addition, with respect to the limitation on the rental
of personal property, we generally have not obtained appraisals of the real property and personal property leased to tenants. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not disagree with
our determinations of value. </FONT></P>

clearly identified as a hedging transaction as specified in the Code will not constitute gross income under, and thus will be exempt from, the 75% and 95% gross income tests. The term "hedging
transaction," as used above, generally means (A)&nbsp;any transaction we enter into in the normal course of our business primarily to manage risk of (1)&nbsp;interest rate changes or fluctuations

is not possible, however, to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. For example, if we fail to satisfy the gross income

reasonable cause. If these relief provisions do not apply to a particular set of circumstances, we will not qualify as a REIT. See "&#151;Failure to Qualify" below. As discussed above

investment objectives. We do not intend, and do not intend to permit any of the partnerships in which we own an interest, to enter into any sales that are prohibited transactions. However, the IRS may
successfully contend that some or all of the sales made by us or our subsidiary partnerships are prohibited transactions. We would be required to pay the 100% penalty tax on our allocable share of the
gains resulting from any such sales. The 100% penalty tax will not apply to gains from the sale of assets that are held through a taxable REIT subsidiary, but such income will be subject to regular
U.S. federal corporate income tax. </FONT></P>

will be subject to a
100% penalty tax. In general, redetermined rents are
rents from real property that are overstated as a result of any services furnished to any of our tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours, redetermined deductions and excess interest represent any
amounts that are deducted by a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on arm's length negotiations, and
redetermined TRS service income is income of a taxable REIT subsidiary that is understated as a result of services provided to us or on our behalf. Rents we receive will not constitute redetermined
rents if they qualify for certain safe harbor provisions contained in the Code. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
do not believe we have been, and do not expect to be, subject to this penalty tax, although any rental or service arrangements we enter into from time to time may not satisfy the
safe-harbor provisions described above. These determinations are inherently factual, and the IRS has broad discretion to assert that amounts paid between related parties should be reallocated to
clearly reflect their respective incomes. If the IRS successfully made such an assertion, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any overstated rents paid to us, or any excess deductions or
understated income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. </FONT></P>

nature and diversification
of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash items and U.S. government securities. For purposes of this test, the term
"real estate assets" generally means real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property or on both real property and, to a limited extent, personal
property), shares (or transferable certificates of beneficial interest) in other REITs, any stock or debt instrument attributable to the investment of the proceeds of a stock offering or a public
offering of debt with a term of at least five years (but only for the one-year period beginning on the date the REIT receives such proceeds), debt instruments of publicly offered REITs, and personal
property leased in connection with a lease of real property for which the rent attributable to personal property is not greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second,
not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities (including securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries), other than those securities includable in
the 75% asset test. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third,
of the investments included in the 25% asset class, and except for certain investments in other REITs, our qualified REIT subsidiaries and taxable REIT subsidiaries, the value of
any one issuer's securities may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets , and we may not own more than 10% of the total vote or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. Certain
types of securities we may own are disregarded as securities solely for purposes of the 10% value test, including, but not limited to, securities satisfying the "straight debt" safe-harbor, securities
issued by a partnership that itself would satisfy the 75% income test if it were a REIT, any loan to an individual or an estate, any obligation to pay rents from real property and any security issued
by a REIT. In addition, solely for purposes of the 10% value test, the determination of our interest in the assets of a partnership in </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>which
we own an interest will be based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership, excluding for this purpose certain securities described in the Code. From time to time
we may own securities (including debt securities) of issuers that do not qualify as a REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary or a taxable REIT subsidiary. We intend that our ownership of any such
securities will be structured in a manner that allows us to comply with the asset tests described above. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth,
not more than 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July&nbsp;30, 2008 and before January&nbsp;1, 2018) of the value of our total assets may be represented by the
securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We currently own 100% of the stock of certain corporations that have elected, together with us, to be treated as our taxable REIT subsidiaries, and
we may acquire securities in additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. So long as each of these companies qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours, we will not be subject to the 5%
asset test, the 10% voting securities limitation or the 10% value limitation with respect to our ownership of the securities of such companies. We believe that the aggregate value of our taxable REIT
subsidiaries has not exceeded, and in the future will not exceed, 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July&nbsp;30, 2008 and before January&nbsp;1, 2018) of the aggregate value of our gross
assets. We generally do not obtain independent appraisals to support these conclusions. In addition, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not disagree with our determinations of value. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth,
not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by debt instruments of publicly offered REITs to the extent those debt instruments would not be real estate
assets but for the inclusion of debt instruments of publicly offered REITs in the meaning of real estate assets, as described above (e.g.,&nbsp;a debt instrument issued by a publicly offered REIT
that is not secured by a mortgage on real property). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
asset tests must be satisfied at the close of each calendar quarter of our taxable year in which we (directly or through our qualified REIT subsidiaries or partnerships) acquire
securities in the applicable issuer, and also at the close of each calendar quarter in which we increase our ownership of securities of such issuer (including as a result of an increase in our
interest in any partnership that owns such securities). For example, our indirect ownership of securities of each issuer may increase as a result of our capital contributions to, or the redemption of
other partners' interests in, a partnership in which we have an ownership interest. Also, after initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter, we will not lose our status as a REIT for
failure to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values. If we fail to satisfy an asset test because we acquire securities or other property during
a quarter (including as a result of an increase in our interest in any partnership), we may cure this failure by disposing of sufficient nonqualifying assets within 30&nbsp;days after the close of
that quarter. We believe that we have maintained, and we intend to maintain, adequate records of the value of our assets to ensure compliance with the asset tests. If we fail to cure any noncompliance
with the asset tests within the 30-day cure period, we would cease to qualify as a REIT unless we are eligible for certain relief provisions discussed below. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
relief provisions may be available to us if we discover a failure to satisfy the asset tests described above after the 30-day cure period. Under these provisions, we will be
deemed to have met the 5% and 10% asset tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets (i)&nbsp;does not exceed the lesser of (a)&nbsp;1% of the total value of our assets at the end of the
applicable quarter or (b)&nbsp;$10,000,000, and (ii)&nbsp;we dispose of the nonqualifying assets or otherwise satisfy such tests within (a)&nbsp;six months after the last day of the quarter in
which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered or (b)&nbsp;the period of time prescribed by Treasury Regulations to be issued. For violations of any of the asset tests due to reasonable
cause and not due to willful neglect and that are, in the case of the 5% and 10% asset tests, in excess of the de minimis exception described above, we may avoid disqualification as a REIT after the
30-day cure period by taking steps including (i)&nbsp;the disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets, or the taking of other actions, which allow us to meet the asset tests within (a)&nbsp;six
months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered or (b)&nbsp;the period of time </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
these purposes, our REIT taxable income is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain. In addition, for purposes of this test, non-cash income
generally means income attributable to leveled stepped rents, original issue discount, cancellation of indebtedness, or a like-kind exchange that is later determined to be taxable. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, our REIT taxable income will be reduced by any taxes we are required to pay on any gain we recognize from the disposition of any asset we acquired from a corporation that is
or has been a C corporation in a transaction in which our tax basis in the asset is less than the fair market value of the asset, in each case determined as of the date on which we acquired the asset,
within the five-year period following our acquisition of such asset, as described above under "&#151;General." </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017, and except as provided below, our deduction for net business interest expense will generally be limited to 30% of our taxable
income, as adjusted for certain items of income, gain, deduction or loss. Any business interest deduction that is disallowed due to this limitation may be carried forward to future taxable years. If
we are subject to this interest expense limitation, our REIT taxable income for a taxable year may be increased. Taxpayers that conduct certain real estate businesses may elect not to have this
interest expense limitation apply to them, provided that they use an alternative depreciation system to depreciate certain property. We believe that we will be eligible to make this election. If we
make this election, although we would not be subject to the interest expense limitation described above, our depreciation deductions may be reduced and, as a result, our REIT taxable income for a
taxable year may be increased. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
generally must pay, or be treated as paying, the distributions described above in the taxable year to which they relate. At our election, a distribution will be treated as paid in a
taxable year if it is declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration, provided such payment is made during
the 12-month period following the close of such year. These distributions are treated as received by our stockholders in the year in which they are paid. This is so even though these distributions
relate to the prior year for purposes of the 90% distribution requirement. In order to be taken into account for purposes of our distribution requirement, except as provided below, the amount
distributed must not be preferential&#151;i.e.,&nbsp;every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class,
and no class of stock may be treated other than according to its dividend rights as a class. This preferential limitation will not apply to distributions made by us, provided we qualify as a "publicly

be, a "publicly offered REIT." To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain, or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our REIT taxable income, as adjusted, we will
be required to pay regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on the undistributed amount. We believe that we have made, and we intend to continue to make, timely distributions sufficient to satisfy
these annual distribution requirements and to minimize our corporate tax obligations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect that our REIT taxable income will be less than our cash flow because of depreciation and other non-cash charges included in computing REIT taxable income. Accordingly, we
anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirements described above. However, from time to time, we may not have sufficient
cash or other liquid assets to meet these distribution requirements due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, and the inclusion of
income and deduction of expenses in determining our taxable income. In addition, we may decide to retain our cash, rather than distribute it, in order to repay debt or for other reasons. If these
timing differences occur, we may borrow funds to pay dividends or pay dividends in the form of taxable stock distributions in order to meet the distribution requirements, while preserving our cash. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
some circumstances, we may be able to rectify an inadvertent failure to meet the 90% distribution requirement for a year by paying "deficiency dividends" to our stockholders in a
later year, which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. In that case, we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, subject to
the 4% excise tax described below. However, we will be required to pay interest to the IRS based upon the amount of any deduction claimed for deficiency dividends. While the payment of a deficiency
dividend will apply to a prior year for purposes of our REIT distribution requirements, it will be treated as an additional distribution to our stockholders in the year such dividend is paid. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
we will be required to pay a 4% excise tax to the extent we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for such year, 95% of
our capital gain net income for the year and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods. Any ordinary income and net capital gain on which corporate income tax is imposed for any year is
treated as an amount distributed during that year for purposes of calculating this excise tax. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of the 90% distribution requirement and excise tax described above, dividends declared during the last three months of the taxable year, payable to stockholders of record on
a specified date during such period and paid during January of the following year, will be treated as paid by us and received by our stockholders on December&nbsp;31 of the year in which they are
declared. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like-Kind Exchanges.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may dispose of real property that is not held primarily for sale in transactions intended to qualify as
like-kind exchanges
under the Code. Such like-kind exchanges are intended to result in the deferral of gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The failure of any such transaction to qualify as a like-kind exchange
could require us to pay U.S. federal income tax, possibly including the 100% prohibited transaction tax, or deficiency dividends, depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular
transaction. </FONT></P>

entities and, in
connection with such acquisitions, we may succeed to the historical tax attributes and liabilities of such entities. For example, if we acquire a C corporation and subsequently dispose of its assets
within five years of the acquisition, we could be required to pay the built-in gain tax described above under "&#151;General." In addition, in order to qualify as a REIT, at the end of any
taxable year, we must not have any earnings and profits accumulated in a non-REIT year. As a result, if we acquire a C corporation, we must distribute the corporation's earnings and profits
accumulated prior to the acquisition before the end of the taxable year in which we acquire the corporation. We also could be required to pay the acquired entity's unpaid taxes even though such
liabilities arose prior to the time we acquired the entity. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
we may from time to time acquire other REITs through a merger or acquisition. If any such REIT failed to qualify as a REIT for any of its taxable years, such REIT would be
liable for (and we, as the surviving corporation in the merger or acquisition, would be obligated to pay) regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on its taxable income for such taxable years. In
addition, if such REIT was a C corporation at the time of the merger or acquisition, the tax consequences described in the preceding paragraph generally would apply. If such REIT failed to qualify as
a REIT for any of its previous taxable years, but qualified as a REIT at the time of such merger or acquisition, and we acquired such REIT's assets in a transaction in which our tax basis in the
assets of such REIT is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to such REIT's tax basis in such assets, we generally would be subject to tax on the built-in gain on each asset of such REIT as
described above if we were to dispose of the asset in a taxable transaction during the five-year period following such REIT's requalification as a REIT, subject to certain exceptions. Moreover, even
if such REIT qualified as a REIT at all relevant times, we would similarly be liable for other unpaid taxes (if any) of such REIT (such as the 100% tax on gains from any sales treated as "prohibited
transactions" as described above under "&#151;Prohibited Transaction Income"). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
after our acquisition of another corporation or entity, the asset and income tests will apply to all of our assets, including the assets we acquire from such corporation or
entity, and to all of our income, including the income derived from the assets we acquire from such corporation or entity. As a result, the nature of the assets that we acquire from such corporation
or entity and the income we derive from those assets may have an effect on our tax status as a REIT. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreclosure Property.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreclosure property rules permit us (by our election) to foreclose or repossess properties without
being disqualified as a
REIT as a result of receiving income that does not qualify under the gross income tests. However, in such a case, we would be subject to the U.S. federal corporate income tax on the net non-qualifying
income from the "foreclosure property," and the after-tax amount would increase the dividends we would be required to distribute to stockholders. See "&#151;Annual Distribution Requirements."
This corporate tax would not apply to income that qualifies under the REIT 75% income test. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreclosure
property treatment will end on the first day on which we enter into a lease of the applicable property that will give rise to income that does not qualify under the REIT 75%
income test, but will not end if the lease will give rise only to qualifying income under such test. Foreclosure property treatment also will end if any construction takes place on the property (other
than completion of a building or other improvement that was more than 10% complete before default became imminent). Foreclosure property treatment is generally available for an initial period of three
years and may, in certain circumstances, be extended for an additional three years. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to Qualify.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we discover a violation of a provision of the Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT,
certain specified
cure provisions may be available to us. Except with respect to violations of the gross income tests and asset tests (for which the cure provisions are described above), and provided the violation is
due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, these cure provisions generally impose a $50,000 penalty for each violation in lieu of a loss of REIT status. If we fail to satisfy the
requirements for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and the relief provisions do not apply, we will be required to pay regular U.S. federal corporate income tax, including any applicable
alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning before January&nbsp;1, 2018, on our taxable income. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be
deductible by us. As a result, we anticipate that our failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our stockholders. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a
REIT, we will not be required to distribute any amounts to our stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and

Tax Aspects of the Subsidiary Partnerships and the Limited Liability Companies  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we may own, directly or indirectly, interests in various partnerships and limited liability
companies. We expect these
will be treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, entities that are treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax
purposes are "pass-through" entities which are not required to pay U.S. federal income tax. Rather, partners of such partnerships are allocated their shares of the items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit of the partnership, and are potentially required to pay tax on this income, without regard to whether they receive a distribution from the partnership. We will include in our
income our share of these partnership items for purposes of the various gross income tests, the computation of our REIT taxable income, and the REIT distribution requirements. Moreover, for purposes
of the asset tests, we will include our pro rata share of assets held by these partnerships, based on our capital interests in each such entity. See "&#151;Taxation of Our
Company&#151;Ownership of Interests in Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies and Qualified REIT Subsidiaries." A disregarded entity is not treated as a separate entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and all assets, liabilities and items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of a disregarded entity are treated as assets, liabilities and items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit of its parent that is not a disregarded entity for all purposes under the Code, including all REIT qualification tests. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entity Classification.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our interests in the subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies involve special tax
considerations, including the
possibility that the IRS might challenge the status of these entities as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For example, an entity that would otherwise be
treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes may nonetheless be taxable as a corporation if it is a "publicly traded partnership" and certain other requirements are met. A partnership
would be treated as a publicly traded partnership if its interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or a substantial equivalent thereof,
within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations. We do not anticipate that any subsidiary partnership will be treated as a publicly traded partnership that is taxable as a corporation. However,
if any such entity were treated as a corporation, it would be required to pay an entity-level tax on its income. In this situation, the character of our assets and items of gross income would change
and could prevent us from satisfying the REIT asset tests and possibly the REIT income tests. See "&#151;Taxation of Our Company&#151;Asset Tests" and
"&#151;Income Tests." This, in turn, could prevent us from qualifying as a REIT. See "&#151;Failure to Qualify" for a discussion of the effect of our failure to meet these tests. In
addition, a change in the tax status of a subsidiary treated as a partnership or disregarded entity to a corporation might be treated as a taxable event. If so, we might incur a tax liability without
any related cash payment. We believe that each of our partnerships and limited liability companies are and will continue to be treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. </FONT></P>

for tax purposes if they do not comply with </FONT></P>

provisions of Section&nbsp;704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Generally, Section&nbsp;704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder require that
partnership allocations respect the economic arrangement of the partners. If an allocation of partnership income or loss does not comply with the requirements of Section&nbsp;704(b) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder, the item subject to the allocation will be reallocated in accordance with the partners' interests in the partnership. This reallocation will be determined by
taking into account all of the facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangement of the partners with respect to such item. We intend that the allocations of taxable income and loss in each
of the partnerships in which we own an interest from time to time comply with the requirements of Section&nbsp;704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax Allocations With Respect to the Properties.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Section&nbsp;704(c) of the Code, income, gain, loss and deduction
attributable to appreciated
or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership must be allocated in a manner so that the contributing partner is charged with the
unrealized gain or benefits from the unrealized loss associated with the property at the time of the contribution. The amount of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss generally is equal to the
difference between the fair market value or book value and the adjusted tax basis of the contributed property at the time of contribution (this difference is referred to as a book-tax difference), as
adjusted from time to time. These allocations are solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes and do not affect the book capital accounts or other economic or legal arrangements among the partners.
Some of the partnerships in which we own an interest were formed by way of contributions of appreciated property. The relevant partnership and/or limited liability company agreements require that
allocations be made in a manner consistent with Section&nbsp;704(c) of the Code. Under Section&nbsp;704(c) of the Code we could be allocated less depreciation or more gain on sale with respect to
a contributed property than the amounts that would have been allocated to us if we had instead acquired the contributed property with an initial tax basis equal to its fair market value. Such
allocations might
adversely affect our ability to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. See "&#151;Taxation of Our Company&#151;Requirements for Qualification as a REIT" and "&#151;Annual
Distribution Requirements." </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
property acquired by a subsidiary partnership in a taxable transaction will initially have a tax basis equal to its fair market value, and Section&nbsp;704(c) of the Code generally
will not apply. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partnership Audit Rules.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 changed the rules applicable to U.S. federal income tax audits of
partnerships. Under the
new rules , among other changes and subject to certain exceptions, any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and any partner's distributive share
thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, or penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected, at the partnership level. Although it is uncertain how certain aspects of these new rules
will be implemented, it is possible that they could result in partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest being required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an
audit adjustment, and we, as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and penalties even though we, as a REIT, may
not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes as a result of the related audit adjustment. The changes created by these new rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent
on the promulgation and finalization of further regulations or other guidance by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these changes
and their potential impact on their investment in our capital stock. </FONT></P>

Taxation of Taxable U.S. Holders of Our Capital Stock  </B></FONT></P>

other than with
respect to capital gain dividends and certain amounts which have previously been subject to corporate level tax, as discussed below, will be taxable to our taxable U.S. holders as ordinary income when
actually or constructively received. See "&#151;Tax Rates" below. As long as we qualify as a REIT, these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction in the case of
U.S. holders that are corporations or, except to the extent described in "&#151;Tax Rates" below, the preferential rates on qualified dividend income applicable to non-corporate U.S. holders,
including individuals. For purposes of determining whether distributions to holders of our capital stock are out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, our earnings and profits will be
allocated first to our outstanding preferred stock, if any, and then to our outstanding common stock. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the extent that we make distributions on our capital stock in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to such stock, these distributions will be treated
first as a tax-free return of capital to a U.S. holder to the extent of the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares of stock. This treatment will reduce the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in
such shares of stock by the amount of the excess of the distribution over our current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to such stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of our
current and accumulated earnings and profits and in excess of a U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares will be taxable as capital gain. Such gain will be taxable as long-term capital gain if
the shares have been held for more than one year. Dividends we declare in October, November, or December of any year and which are payable to a holder of record on a specified date in any of these
months will be treated as both paid by us and received by the holder on December&nbsp;31 of that year, provided we actually pay the dividend on or before January&nbsp;31 of the following year.
U.S. holders may not include in their own income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses. </FONT></P>

for the taxable year, including dividends paid the following year that are treated as paid in the current year. U.S. holders that are corporations may, however, be required to treat up to 20% of
certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income. If we properly designate any portion of a dividend as a capital gain dividend, then, except as otherwise required by law, we presently intend to

determining whether any of these tests has been met, shares of our capital stock, including common stock and other equity interests in us, considered to be owned by the U.S. holder by
reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the Code, as well as shares of our capital stock actually owned by the U.S. holder, generally must be taken into account. Because the
determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of Section&nbsp;302(b) of the Code will be satisfied with respect to the U.S. holder depends upon the facts and circumstances at the time

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a redemption or repurchase of shares of our capital stock is treated as a distribution, the amount of the distribution will be measured by the amount of cash and the fair market value

shares of our capital stock, if any. If a U.S. holder owns no other shares of our capital stock, under certain circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost
entirely. Proposed Treasury Regulations issued in 2009, if enacted in their current form, would affect the basis recovery
rules described above. It is not clear whether these proposed regulations will be enacted in their current form or at all. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S.

certain holding period requirements have been met and the REIT's dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations (such as its taxable REIT subsidiaries) or to income that
was subject to tax at the corporate/REIT level (for example, if the REIT distributed taxable income that it retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year). Capital gain dividends will only be
eligible for the rates described above to the extent that they are properly designated by the REIT as "capital gain dividends." U.S. holders that are corporations may be required to treat up to 20% of
some capital gain dividends as ordinary income. In addition, non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, generally may deduct up to 20% of dividends from a REIT, other than capital gain
dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income, for taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017 and before January&nbsp;1, 2026. </FONT></P>

This income or gain will be UBTI, however, to the extent a tax-exempt holder holds its shares as "debt-financed property" within the meaning of the Code. Generally, "debt-financed property" is
property the acquisition or holding of which was financed through a borrowing by the tax-exempt holder. </FONT></P>

concerning these "set aside" and reserve requirements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the above, however, a portion of the dividends paid by a "pension-held REIT" may be treated as UBTI as to certain trusts that hold more than 10%, by value, of the
interests in the REIT. A REIT will not be a "pension-held REIT" if it is able to satisfy the "not closely held" requirement without relying on the "look-through" exception with respect to certain
trusts or if such REIT is not "predominantly held" by "qualified trusts." As a result of restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock contained in our charter, we do not expect to be classified
as a "pension-held REIT," and as a result, the tax treatment described above should be inapplicable to our holders. However, because our common stock is (and, we anticipate, will continue to be)

they are made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Such distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be

apply to dividends from a REIT. Certain certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied for a non-U.S. holder to be exempt from withholding under the effectively connected income
exemption. Dividends that are treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business generally will not be subject to withholding but will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis

21% U.S. withholding tax described above, if the non-U.S. holder did not own more than 10% of such class of stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution.
Instead, such distributions generally will be treated as ordinary dividend distributions and subject to withholding in the manner described above with respect to ordinary dividends. In addition,
distributions to certain non-U.S. publicly traded shareholders that meet certain record-keeping and other requirements ("qualified shareholders") are exempt from FIRPTA, except to the extent owners of
such qualified shareholders that are not also qualified shareholders own, actually or constructively, more than 10% of our capital stock. Furthermore, distributions to "qualified foreign pension

USRPI so long as we are a "domestically controlled qualified investment entity." A "domestically controlled qualified investment entity" includes a REIT in which at all times during a five-year
testing period less than 50% in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by non-United States persons, subject to certain rules. For purposes of determining whether a REIT is a "domestically
controlled qualified investment entity," a person who at all applicable times holds less than 5% of a class of stock that is "regularly traded" is treated as a United States person unless the REIT has
actual knowledge that such person is not a United States person. We believe, but cannot guarantee, that we are a "domestically controlled qualified investment entity." Because our common stock is

Taxation of Holders of Our Debt Securities  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following summary describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of our debt securities.
This discussion assumes the debt securities will be issued with less than a statutory </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>de minimis</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> amount of original issue discount for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the debt securities for cash at original issue and at their original "issue price" within the meaning of
Section&nbsp;1273 of the Code (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>i.e.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>,&nbsp;the first price at which a substantial amount of the debt securities is sold to the public for cash). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments of Interest.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest on a debt security generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time such
interest is received
or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder's method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sale or Other Taxable Disposition.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A U.S. holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable
disposition of a debt security. The amount of such gain or loss generally will be equal to the difference between the amount received for the debt security in cash or other property valued at fair
market value (less amounts attributable to any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest to the extent not previously included in income) and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis
in the debt security. A U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in a debt security generally will be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for the debt security. Any gain or loss generally will be capital
gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the debt security for more than one year at the time of such sale or other taxable disposition. Otherwise, such
gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, generally will be taxable at reduced rates. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. </FONT></P>

withholding tax described above. To claim the exemption, the non-U.S. holder must furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid IRS Form&nbsp;W-8ECI, certifying that interest paid on a debt

Additional Withholding Tax on Payments Made to Foreign Accounts  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withholding taxes may be imposed under Sections&nbsp;1471 to 1474 of the Code (such sections commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act, or FATCA) on certain types of payments made to non-U.S. financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on dividends on
our capital stock, interest on our debt securities, or gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our capital stock or debt securities, in each case paid to a "foreign financial institution"
or a "non-financial foreign entity" (each as defined in the Code), unless (1)&nbsp;the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations, (2)&nbsp;the
non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any "substantial United States owners" (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United
States owner, or (3)&nbsp;the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and
is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements in clause&nbsp;(1) above, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring, among other things, that it
undertake to identify accounts held by certain "specified United States persons" or "United States owned foreign entities" (each as defined in the Code), annually report certain information about such
accounts, and withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an
intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of dividends on our capital stock or interest on our debt
securities, and will apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such stock or debt securities on or after January&nbsp;1, 2019. Because we may not know the extent to
which a distribution is a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the time it is made, for purposes of these withholding rules we may treat the entire distribution as a dividend. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospective
investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding under FATCA to their investment in our capital stock or debt securities. </FONT></P>

Other Tax Consequences  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State, local and non-U.S. income tax laws may differ substantially from the corresponding U.S. federal income tax laws, and this discussion does
