Investment<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">SM</SUP> (the Notes) is designed to provide you with a convenient means of investing your money directly with Dominion Energy, Inc. (Dominion Energy or the Company). The Notes earn a floating
rate of interest to be determined at the direction of the Dominion Energy Reliability Investment Committee (the Committee). The initial interest rate applicable to the Notes and all subsequent changes to the initial interest rate will be disclosed
in prospectus supplements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes are in book-entry form and have no stated maturity. The
Notes are issuable in any amount, may be redeemed upon your demand as described in this prospectus and are subject to redemption by Dominion Energy at any time. The Notes have a principal amount equal to the total amount of your investment, plus
reinvested interest, after deducting redemptions and fees, if any. The Notes earn interest which will accrue and be compounded daily and be automatically reinvested in Notes on the last business day of each month. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes will rank equally in priority with all of Dominion Energy&#146;s existing and future unsecured and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-subordinated</FONT> debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of Dominion Energy&#146;s existing and future subordinated debt. As of December 31, 2018, Dominion Energy had approximately
$13.7&nbsp;billion principal amount of outstanding long-term debt on an unconsolidated basis (including securities due within one year), consisting of approximately $8.3&nbsp;billion of unsecured and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-subordinated</FONT> debt and $5.4&nbsp;billion of unsecured junior subordinated debt. The Notes are also structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of Dominion Energy&#146;s subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries, excluding SCANA Corporation (SCANA), had approximately $21.3 billion principal amount of outstanding long-term debt (including securities due within one year and credit facility borrowings). As of December
31, 2018, SCANA had approximately $6.8 billion principal amount of outstanding long-term debt (including securities due within one year and credit facility borrowings). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes are offered on a continuous basis. Notes registered on the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part represent the maximum aggregate
principal amount of the Notes, equal to $3,000,000,000, which are expected to be offered for sale. The outstanding principal amount of the Notes will increase and decrease from time to time. The maximum net aggregate principal amount of the Notes
that may be outstanding at any one time is $1,000,000,000. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P><center>

information, contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus. You should consult your own financial and legal advisers as to the risks involved in an investment in the Notes and whether an investment is suitable for you. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>All of the money you invest will be used to purchase Notes for you. All interest earned on your Notes will be reinvested monthly in
additional Notes for your investment. All investments in the Notes are investments in unsecured debt obligations of Dominion Energy, Inc. Only our assets are available to pay the principal and interest on the Notes. We do not maintain reserves for
our obligations under the Notes and the Notes are not subject to any sinking fund. The Notes are unsecured and are not obligations of or guaranteed, endorsed or insured by any of our subsidiaries, The Northern Trust Company, which acts as the agent
bank for the Notes, the Trustee or any other company. It is possible for you to lose some or all of your investment, including accrued interest, if we are unable to pay our debts, become bankrupt or seek creditor protection. </B></P>

Notes are not subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (including those regarding diversification and quality of investments for money market funds) or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The
Notes are not equivalent to a deposit or other bank account and are not subject to the protection of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulation or insurance or any other insurance. The Notes are not transferable, assignable or negotiable, they
are not listed on any securities exchange, and there is no secondary market for the Notes. As a result, there is no public market valuation for the Notes. </B></P>

may use a different method of calculating yield, or other investments which pay a fixed yield for a stated period of time. The interest rate also does not necessarily bear any relation to the risks associated with or changes in our creditworthiness,
credit rating or financial condition and may not compensate you for any increase in credit risk of investment in the Notes. </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of November&nbsp;1, 2017, between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, which acts as
trustee. The trustee has two main roles. First, the trustee can enforce your rights against us if we default. There are some limitations on the extent to which the trustee acts on your behalf, described below under &#147;Events of Default and
Notices.&#148; Second, the trustee may perform certain administrative duties for us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The indenture and its associated documents contain
the full legal text of the matters described in this section. The indenture is an exhibit to our registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. See &#147;Where You Can Find More Information&#148; for information on how to obtain a copy
of the indenture. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This section summarizes the material terms of the Notes. Because this section is a summary, it does not describe every
aspect of the Notes and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to all provisions of the indenture, including definitions of certain terms used in the indenture. We describe the meaning for only the more important of those terms.
Whenever we refer to defined terms of the indenture in this prospectus, such defined terms are incorporated by reference here. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>General </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes will be issuable in any amount and will mature upon your demand. The Notes will be identical except for their issue date and
principal amount. We may reject any offer to purchase Notes in whole or in part. All investments in the Notes are investments in our unsecured debt obligations and are not obligations of or guaranteed by our subsidiaries, the agent bank, the trustee
or any other company. Dominion Energy does not maintain reserves for its obligations under the Notes and the Notes are not subject to any sinking fund. The Notes are redeemable at your option in the manner described in this prospectus. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following an initial investment, investors may make additional investments and redemptions from time to time as described in this prospectus.
As a result, the outstanding principal amount of the Notes will increase and decrease from time to time. For purposes of determining the aggregate amount of registered but unissued notes under the registration statement relating to the Notes, each
investment is an issuance of Notes, reducing the capacity of registered but unissued Notes by a corresponding amount. The daily amount and rate of redemptions are affected by many factors, including but not limited to the rates we offer on the Notes
from time to time, the wide variety of alternative investment options in the market that are available to our investors and seasonal increases in redemptions and investments. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although investors could seek to redeem a large dollar amount of Notes over a short period of time, we believe that we have sufficient capital
resources available to timely fund redemptions of the Notes. Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term component of our treasury management strategy. In the event that we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally,
additional sources of funds are available to us. For more information, see the discussion of our capital resources and liquidity in our Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-Q</FONT> reports filed
with the SEC that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes will rank equally in priority with all of Dominion
Energy&#146;s existing and future unsecured and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-subordinated</FONT> debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of Dominion Energy&#146;s existing and future subordinated debt. As of December 31, 2018,
Dominion Energy had approximately $13.7&nbsp;billion principal amount of outstanding long-term debt on an unconsolidated basis (including securities due within one year), consisting of approximately $8.3&nbsp;billion of unsecured and <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-subordinated</FONT> debt and $5.4&nbsp;billion of unsecured junior subordinated debt. Dominion Energy is a holding company, and we operate our businesses through our subsidiaries. The Notes are structurally
subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. This means that in liquidation the assets of our subsidiaries would be applied first to the repayment of indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries
