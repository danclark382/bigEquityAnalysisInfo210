The report adds that Apple has also asked Luxshare and fellow Chinese manufacturer Goertek to boost production of the regular AirPods at their Vietnam-based factories, although it is unclear by how much. AirPods Pro are currently estimated for delivery around December 31 through Apple's online store in the United States, so orders placed today are not guaranteed to arrive in time for Christmas. However, authorized resellers such as Amazon , Best Buy , AT&T , and T-Mobile still quote delivery within the first week of December. Amazon is even offering a slight discount on the AirPods Pro for Black Friday, pricing them at $234.98, a savings of nearly $15. AirPods are considered to be the world's best selling truly wireless earphones, with surging popularity since their release in late 2016.", "related": "AAPL", "image": "https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/6f4006cc-1bb4-452c-a67c-1c7c75e6f088", "lang": "en", "hasPaywall": false}, {"datetime": 1574874624000, "headline": "Apple is accused of using tighter privacy claims as a cloak for anti-competitive behaviour", "source": "Daily Mail Online", "url": "https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/article/35b4f466-cbed-43f2-9aea-10cf7f61a609", "summary": "US lawmakers have accused Apple of engaging in anti-competitive behaviour after they announced changes to their mobile phone operating system with new privacy features.", "related": "AAPL", "image": "https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/35b4f466-cbed-43f2-9aea-10cf7f61a609", "lang": "en", "hasPaywall": false}, {"datetime": 1574873607000, "headline": "Apple changes its Crimea map to show the annexed peninsula as part of Russian territory", "source": "Daily Mail Online", "url": "https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/article/55e8631d-7a61-4881-ba97-fbef60885695", "summary": "Russian legislators proudly announced that the US tech giant Apple had complied with their demands in the lower parliament, the State Duma, on Wednesday.", "related": "AAPL", "image": "https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/55e8631d-7a61-4881-ba97-fbef60885695", "lang": "en", "hasPaywall": false}, {"datetime": 1574873311000, "headline": "Deals Spotlight: B&H Photo Discounts 16-Inch MacBook Pro by $200 (Starting at $2,199 for 512GB)", "source": "Mac Rumors", "url": "https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/article/1157b33e-b8bf-48a0-a049-1ede75a37cc9", "summary": "B&H Photo is offering $200 discounts on the two main configurations of Apple's 16-inch MacBook Pro.
