 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Also today, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> announced its plans to lay a foundation for the
transformational New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> 5G network that will enable these moves with its never-before-seen massive capacity and depth. The company is lighting up nationwide 5G on December&nbsp;6, covering more than
200&nbsp;million Americans and more than 5,000 cities and towns across the country including millions in rural America. Customers will be able to tap into <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> LTE and 5G network using the Samsung
Galaxy Note10+ 5G or OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren. And both phones will be able to tap into Sprint&#146;s <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-band</FONT> 5G spectrum with the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> in 2020. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;We&#146;re building a 5G network that will allow us to deliver future New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> moves that are going to be SO
massive we couldn&#146;t WAIT to share the first few. We have definitively put a stake in the ground around the kind of company the supercharged <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> will be and the ways we can put this radically better
5G network to work doing GOOD for this country &#151; good for consumers, good for competition and good for innovation! Only the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> transformative 5G network will FINALLY have the capacity and
reach to make the BOLD moves we announced today that are squarely aimed at SOLVING inequities that have huge impacts on our society. When it comes to wireless service, many have been taken advantage of, left behind or completely forgotten. It&#146;s
time for another wave of change and the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> will be at the forefront of that!&#148; said John Legere, CEO of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Legere continued, &#147;The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> is once again going to force change &#151; this time by focusing on doing the
right thing for those most in need and deserving of reliable wireless service. With the 5G network the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is set to build, we&#146;ll be able to ease the burden of tight budgets for ALL of our
nation&#146;s first responders through our Connecting Heroes Initiative&#133; give MILLIONS of our nation&#146;s kids the access to fast, affordable and convenient internet that they deserve through Project 10Million &#133; and deliver more for less
through the lowest priced <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> plan we&#146;ve EVER had &#151; <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> Connect. We are READY to do this and hoping this deal will close so we can get to work!&#148;
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Connecting Heroes Initiative </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Americans rely on
first responders, and first responders rely on capable wireless services. In an emergency, no connection is more important. Yet, across the country, many of the nation&#146;s first responder organizations &#151; state, county and city agencies
&#151; face a budget crisis year after year. Today, more than 75% of fire chiefs describe budget limitations as a top challenge. First responders and the communities they serve should not have to decide between important equipment and wireless
services. Every single day, these dedicated professionals see it all, they fight it all and they help us all &#151; when we need it most. Those who serve us all, deserve better. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through Connecting Heroes, the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is making an up to $7.7&nbsp;billion,
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-year</FONT> commitment to make FREE unlimited talk, text and smartphone data available to EVERY first responder at EVERY public and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</FONT> state and local police, fire
and EMS first responder agency across the entire country! Participating first responders will always have the highest priority of any plan on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> network no matter how much data they use &#151; and
Connecting Heroes gives them money back in their budgets to support other crucial needs like life-saving tools and extra pay. This is 5G FOR GOOD. Starting with today&#146;s <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> announcement, any public
and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</FONT> state, county or city police, fire or EMS agency interested in Connecting Heroes can get on the list at <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">t-mobile.com/connectingheroes.</FONT> </P>

in this country with children, and of those, about 15% have no home internet. At the same time, seven in ten teachers assign online homework. Where education should be a leveler, students without connectivity are at a disadvantage when they&#146;re
unable to complete assignments or even simply communicate with teachers and peers. Studies show that those students without home internet access have a consistent pattern of lower scores in reading, math and science. This is the homework gap &#151;
and it&#146;s just not right. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> Project 10Million aims to eradicate the U.S. homework gap
through an unprecedented $10&nbsp;billion commitment that will deliver free internet access over the next five years and another $700&nbsp;million commitment in hardware to 10&nbsp;million households. Eligible families in the U.S. and Puerto Rico
will receive up to 100GB of FREE internet access each year, one FREE Mobile <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Wi-Fi</FONT> enabled hotspot and the option to purchase select <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Wi-Fi</FONT> enabled devices at the
company&#146;s cost. And like all New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> customers, Project 10Million recipients will benefit from the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> expanded 5G capabilities. </P>

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> will be able to help customers who need service most, but struggle to fit it in their budget. With the new <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> Connect, all U.S. and Puerto Rico consumers
will get an unprecedented HALF OFF of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> lowest priced plan, and access to the New T-Mobile&#146;s supercharged 5G network. At just $15 per month, the plan will give customers unlimited talk and
text with 2GB of high-speed smartphone data. That is an estimated annual savings of $180 per year! For $25 per month, customers get 5GB of high-speed data. And because we know that customers use more data every year,
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> Connect will also have an innovative Annual Data Upgrade to give customers an additional 500MB of data per month, every year, for the next five years! This is the first plan that automatically gets
