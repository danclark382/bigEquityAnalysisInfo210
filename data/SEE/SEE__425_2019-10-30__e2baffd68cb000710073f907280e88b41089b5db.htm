<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let me give you a quick update on our merger with Sprint. We are very pleased that after an exhaustive review of the facts, the Federal Communications
Commission voted to approve the merger on October 16. Now both expert agencies, the FCC and the DOJ, have validated the merits of a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and Sprint combination. As we work through the final steps of
closing our merger, we remain convinced that the merits of the deal are even more true today. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It&#146;s important to point out that the target synergies,
profitability and long-term cash generation have not changed for New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> We continue to expect that the merger will deliver more than $43&nbsp;billion in synergies, while almost tripling our total
spectrum holdings in low and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-band.</FONT> This positions New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> to become the nationwide leader in 5G, leapfrogging the competition in network capability and customer
experience. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This network capability will enable us to supercharge the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> strategy and aggressively take
share from the predatory incumbents. New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> will support the creation of thousands of new jobs across America, net positive from Day 1, and deliver lower prices and unrivaled value on the nation&#146;s
best network, transforming our customers&#146; lives in ways we can&#146;t even imagine. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Now while the deal closing has taken longer than planned, the
silver lining is that we have had more time to prepare for the coming integration. We have detailed integration plans, and we are preparing to start deploying Sprint&#146;s 2.5 gigahertz spectrum soon after closing. We&#146;re working hard to
complete the final steps for the merger and we remain confident and optimistic. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the majority vote from the FCC, we received clearance for
the merger from the DOJ in late July upon entering into a Consent Decree that included the divestiture of all of Sprint&#146;s prepaid businesses and Sprint&#146;s 800 megahertz spectrum assets to DISH as well as supporting DISH&#146;s rapid entry
into the wireless market. The DOJ Consent Decree is still subject to the final Tunney Act review, as most of you know. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Earlier this month, the state of
Florida joined the DOJ settlement and Mississippi and Colorado came off the state AG complaint. In total, 19 state governments &#150; State AGs, Governors and/or PUCs &#150; have now expressed their support for the merger, highlighting benefits such
as increased competition, rural coverage, jobs, affordability and new wireless competition for fixed broadband access. On that note, 18 of 19 PUCs have given this deal the green light. We have a lot of leaders that recognize the benefits that this
transaction will deliver for consumers in their state and beyond. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Now as you know, the state AG trial is set to begin on December 9. In the meantime, we
continued to be open to and are having many discussions with the state AGs. We now expect the merger will be permitted to close in early 2020. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let&#146;s talk network for a moment. You
may have heard the news that Neville announced last week, that he and his engineering team have been running at an incredible pace, building out our initial layer for 5G. In fact, we announced that we are accelerating the build out and plan to
launch our foundational layer of 5G nationwide this year. Our 600 megahertz spectrum will be the foundation for our 5G network and it&#146;s live in nearly 8,300 cities and towns in 48 states and Puerto Rico. This deployment covers 1.4&nbsp;million
square miles and 200&nbsp;million POPs today. We now have thousands of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">5G-ready</FONT> towers and cell sites capable of lighting up 5G on our 600 megahertz spectrum, and no other 5G signal will be as strong or as
reliable. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">More than 26&nbsp;million devices that are 600 megahertz compatible are already on our network today. We plan to launch 5G on 600 megahertz on
a nationwide footprint of more than 200&nbsp;million POPs with compatible smartphones, including the recently announced exclusive OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren later this year. This network will be the foundational 5G coverage layer for New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> part of the overall layer cake of available low, mid and high band spectrum for 5G that will be a game changer for consumers. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> nationwide 5G will be able to cover more people
in more places and work indoors and out. Unlike Verizon and AT&amp;T&#146;s current 5G networks, which can be blocked by things like walls, glass and leaves. And this is all while we continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage and deliver
industry-leading performance. We&#146;ve caught up to AT&amp;T and Verizon and now have 326&nbsp;million Americans covered with 4G LTE, nearly 99% of the U.S. population. And we now have 311&nbsp;million Americans covered by low band spectrum, both
600 megahertz and 700 megahertz combined. So needless to say, we continue to make great progress on our network and can&#146;t wait to get 5G into the hands of consumers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;ve spent the better part of the last 7 years changing wireless for good. And with the network capabilities of New
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> we&#146;re going to take <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> to an entirely new level. So I think it&#146;s time we start sharing some of what we mean by next level. I won&#146;t say
anymore today, but please, mark November&nbsp;7 on your calendars, because we are going to announce our first <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> move for the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> sharing some of our
plans and commitments for the future. That&#146;s right. New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> 1.0, November 7. Stay tuned. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Michael Rollins </B>- Citigroup Inc,
Research Division&#151;MD and U.S. Telecoms Analyst </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With regards to the process with the State AGs, are there a couple of common pushbacks or concerns
that you&#146;re learning about across the states that are involved with the litigation? And is there an opportunity for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> 1.0 for the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> to
potentially address some of those questions or concerns? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>*** </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere&#151;CEO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I could tell you it&#146;s been a
fascinating 1.5 years, whether it&#146;s been in Congress or the Senate or FCC and the DOJ, and now the State Attorney General&#146;s. We violently agree on all the things that are important, all the things that are important for the states and
violently agree on what the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> can do. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So if you think about the federal agencies that have now
approved &#150; the expert agencies that have approved this deal, it&#146;s been about ensuring 5G investment and 5G build and rural coverage and broadband competition, concerns about pricing, concerns about the low end of the market. And what
we&#146;ve been able to do, as you&#146;ve seen recently with both Colorado and Mississippi, is once you speak to these individual Attorneys General about their state and the things that are important to them, they see that what they are concerned
about is committed to nationally and can be tailored for them. So we have been having very good discussions, and we continue to have those. They continue to center around 5G and the build and pricing and around DISH as a competitive player, which
certainly we have been very aggressive with the Consent Decree on positioning for that. So we feel very good about the conversations and where they&#146;re headed, and we feel very good and confident either in the process of a settlement or in going
to trial and having the case seen well. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And to your point, certainly, the kinds of things that the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT>
will signal that we will do, whether it be an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> move or the plans that we&#146;ll start to unveil, they are very powerful items of discussion with the states as well because they answer the main
questions. So it&#146;s all coming together in that fashion. Stay tuned. Good discussions continue. And as I said, we may &#150; we remain very optimistic and confident about the creation of the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT>
And yes, I think November&nbsp;7, Mike, might add a little bit to the conversation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A question on the 600 build out, I&#146;m not sure if Neville was on. But just you&#146;ve done 200&nbsp;million POPs, I think Braxton had referred to a CapEx
being front end loaded. So what&#146;s the pacing from here to get to 250&nbsp;million POPs and more over the next few quarters? Is this something where it&#146;s going to be slower to go? And how should we think about the expectation there? And
then, Mike, coming back to your comments on the first responder, could you just size that opportunity for us, what you have today and what you think the opportunity there is? </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Thanks, Simon. Obviously, we&#146;re very pleased with the progress we&#146;ve made on 600 megahertz and it&#146;s really adding to this phenomenal low band
footprint that we&#146;ve assembled over the last 3 to 4 years. I mean, John referenced it, 311&nbsp;million people now covered with low band and we continue to grow that number as we light up more and more of the 600 megahertz. And 26&nbsp;million
customers now with a 600 megahertz phone in their hands, starting to really reap the benefits of a lot of new spectrum that we can bring to the U.S. consumer, both in LTE and 5G. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As we said many times, this is the foundational layer of the layer cake with the new <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> as we combined with
Sprint. It&#146;s critical to what we planned to do. With that fabulous combination, we are super excited about what we can bring. And so to your question, yes, no slowdown on 600 megahertz. As we move into 2020, we obviously look to continue to
build out that footprint across the nation. And remember, we have nationwide, I mean, fully <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">coast-to-coast</FONT></FONT> spectrum here that we can leverage. And it&#146;s a key part
of the commitments that we&#146;ve made to the FCC and many others in terms of our buildout of 5G services and LTE. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P>

of deploying 5G coverage. I&#146;m curious, how do you plan to message the benefits of 5G to consumers? How is that going to change as you start to incorporate Sprint&#146;s deep spectrum portfolio? And then, ultimately, are you willing to offer
consumers incentives to try 5G on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile?</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere&#151;CEO </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Actually, we&#146;ve come up with a few ideas. First of all, we&#146;ve decided to label it 5GE, and we&#146;ve decided that no matter where we deploy our 5G,
we&#146;re refusing to show it in maps. So outside of those 2 innovative ways &#150; but yes, Mike or Neville, do you want to... </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Michael

partners with the mainstream devices to adopt your technology, as we were just talking about responsibly to the last question, how quickly that can benefit consumers. And you&#146;re seeing that right now with the 600 megahertz. We&#146;re delighted
that our major partners with the big flagship devices were able to get our 600 megahertz LTE technology on the devices last year. And as a result, we now have 26&nbsp;million people with that technology in their hands. And I think that bodes very
well for us as we think about a future in 5G, which again, we have a big opportunity to get the ecosystem aligned. And I don&#146;t think it&#146;s going to take incentives to get people to try <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> 5G.
They&#146;re going to move to it very enthusiastically. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our strategy is going to look &#150; so as John was just saying, our strategy is going to look so different
from our competitors. They&#146;re doing &#150; in particular, Verizon is making a bet that people will want versions of 5G that work in some places, very limited places, and don&#146;t work in most places, versus a 5G that works nationwide and that
we&#146;re willing to back with maps. And that&#146;s the beginning of a journey, to the premise of your question, when you combine it with where we&#146;re going in the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> the journey towards the
only 5G network that is both broad, as we&#146;re talking about, that&#146;s nationwide and everywhere, and deep, with transformational capacity and speeds that really can change the use cases for our consumers in very profound ways. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">That&#146;s a little early to predict all the applications and innovations. But I can tell you one thing, as somebody that&#146;s been close to software,
innovators are going to choose the network that&#146;s both broad and deep, that relies on having 5G everywhere. You&#146;re going to see use cases that are designed more to our way of thinking than to Verizon&#146;s way of thinking which is that
some people want 5G in a few places to be very high capacity and everywhere else you&#146;ll be relegated to LTE. I don&#146;t think that will inspire the same kind of mobile innovation that we&#146;re going to see the New <FONT

with Sprint. We&#146;ve been partners in this transaction for a long time, working <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">side-by-side</FONT></FONT> in a very cooperative way, and we really are working diligently to close

publicly. But they&#146;ve been a great partner, and if there are issues that we need to work together, we&#146;ll work together with them to solve those. And if we do have any items to announce, you&#146;ll be the first to hear. </P>
