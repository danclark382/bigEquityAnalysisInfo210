<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>When we say we&#146;ll do something, we mean it! </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">John
Legere&nbsp;| May&nbsp;20, 2019 </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Over the last few months, I&#146;ve been writing a lot about the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">New&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;and</FONT> the various ways a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">supercharged&nbsp;Un-carrier&nbsp;will</FONT> benefit American consumers and businesses. I&#146;ve also been doing a lot of
listening. After all, we built <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">this&nbsp;Un-carrier&nbsp;revolution</FONT> by listening to others and then acting decisively. So why would we approach this merger any differently? As we&#146;ve made our case for the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">New&nbsp;T-Mobile,&nbsp;we&#146;ve</FONT> been listening to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and many others. Today, we took some action on those discussions, and we submitted a set of commitments to the FCC
around the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">New&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;to</FONT> address what we&#146;ve heard. We listen and we take action. It&#146;s who we are. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let me be clear. These aren&#146;t just words&#133; they&#146;re verifiable, enforceable and specific commitments that bring to life how the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">New&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;will</FONT> deliver a world-leading nationwide 5G network &#150; truly 5G for all, create more competition in broadband, and continue to give customers more choices, better value and better service.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I particularly want to thank Chairman Pai for his statement of support for these commitments and our merger &#150; as well as his ongoing leadership to
help ensure our country is a leader, not a follower, in the 5G era. We look forward to continuing to meet and work with a variety of important stakeholders to demonstrate the powerful benefits the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">New&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;will</FONT> bring &#150; but today&#146;s filing is at the center of our plans to bring 5G to American consumers. Ultimately, today&#146;s commitments are about our shared goal to put the U.S.
at the forefront of 5G innovation, driving massive economic growth, helping bridge the Digital Divide, creating more competition, and of course, giving consumers and businesses more for less. The commitments we&#146;re making today help advance all
of these goals! It is that simple. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Specific Enforceable Commitments to Deliver 5G for All </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">First, we&#146;ve committed to key milestones we&#146;ll hit as we build out 5G for ALL &#150; both on a nationwide scale and specifically for rural America.
We&#146;ve laid out aggressive targets for this supercharged 5G network. In three years, we&#146;ve committed that the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">New&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;will</FONT> cover 97% of the U.S. population with 5G <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on&nbsp;low-band&nbsp;spectrum</FONT> and 75% of the population with 5G <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on&nbsp;mid-band&nbsp;spectrum.</FONT> That will grow to 99% of the U.S. population covered <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">with&nbsp;low-band&nbsp;5G</FONT> in six years and 88% <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">with&nbsp;mid-band&nbsp;5G.</FONT> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This is critically important because it ensures that this country will have broad AND deep nationwide 5G utilizing both mid and low band spectrum, which will
deliver a radically better, more expansive experience than the status quo. This should also force Verizon and AT&amp;T <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">to&nbsp;re-evaluate&nbsp;their</FONT> 5G strategies and accelerate their investment and 5G
deployment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also established milestones to cover 85% of rural America with 5G <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on&nbsp;low-band&nbsp;spectrum</FONT>
in three years and 90% in six years. We set targets for the number of people with access to equal or greater than 100 Mbps and 50 Mbps average download speeds (hint: it&#146;s a lot&#133; 90% and 99% of the country&#146;s population respectively in
six years, and we even outlined how we&#146;ll verify those speeds with drive tests!). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;ve also made clear commitments <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">around&nbsp;in-home&nbsp;broadband.</FONT> I&#146;ve said before that we are going <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">to&nbsp;&#147;Un-carrier&#148;&nbsp;broadband,</FONT> and that&#146;s what we&#146;re going to do. Because
this is one of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">most&nbsp;un-competitive&nbsp;industries</FONT> in the country &#150; and the least customer-friendly! Almost half the country&#146;s households &#150; 45% &#150; have no high-speed service or only
one option to choose from. The numbers are worse for rural households, 76% of which have no high-speed service or only one choice available. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With our
nationwide 5G network, we can change this dynamic! So, we made real commitments to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">offer&nbsp;in-home&nbsp;broadband</FONT> to a specific number of households across the U.S., including in rural areas, in very
specific timeframes. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I believe we will nail all of these goals &#150; nationwide 5G, rural 5G
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">and&nbsp;in-home&nbsp;broadband!</FONT> We are so confident in our ability to follow through that we are willing to put our money where our mouth is by committing to specific measures that will hold us
accountable&#133; You see, if we don&#146;t meet these milestones, we&#146;ll pay until we do. These are tangible commitments that we are happy to be held to. Why? Because when we say we&#146;ll do something, we mean it. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And we believe in transparency on all of this, so we&#146;ll give an annual report card to the FCC to show our progress. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This clear set of specific, enforceable commitments reinforces our plans and bring them to life &#150; and show what I&#146;ve been saying all along: this 5G
network will make a huge difference for millions of Americans across the entire country. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>An Independent Path for Boost </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Another area of FCC feedback we heard is around the prepaid business. In response, we have committed to divest Sprint&#146;s
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Boost&nbsp;pre-paid&nbsp;business</FONT> to a third party following the closing of the merger. We&#146;ll work to find a serious, credible, financially capable and independent buyer for all the assets needed to run
&#150; and grow &#150; the business, and we&#146;ll make sure that buyer has attractive wholesale arrangements. This is an exciting opportunity for Boost employees and customers with a buyer bringing the ability to invest in the brand and the
opportunity to run on the supercharged <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">New&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;network!</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have always chosen to <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">serve&nbsp;pre-paid&nbsp;customers.</FONT> To give hardworking people everywhere the wireless they deserve. Wireless they can be proud of. It&#146;s part of who we are to offer underserved communities more choice and value
in wireless. That&#146;s a big part of why we&#146;ve been able to more than double the size of Metro since 2013. We aren&#146;t backing down from that commitment &#150; at all &#150; and we plan to compete aggressively <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in&nbsp;pre-paid&nbsp;with</FONT> Metro and Virgin in the years ahead. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Same or Better Prices! </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Now this one, I&#146;ve said before, and we&#146;ve already put our commitment in writing to the FCC. The commitment still stands. The <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">New&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;will</FONT> deliver the same or better rate plans at the same or better prices for three years. And that includes 5G. Period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But I&#146;m not quite done yet&#133; when we combine the Sprint <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">and&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;networks,</FONT> we&#146;re going to
create a 5G network with 8x more capacity by 2024 than Sprint <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">or&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;standalone</FONT> today. We&#146;re going to want MVNO partners to help put all that capacity to use, and today&#146;s commitments
also address that. We want to work with a whole community of partners to utilize all the capacity this deal will unlock! </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are going to bring 5G to
every corner of this country and challenge the failing status quo that has left millions of Americans with too few options and too little value, tolerating terrible treatment and believing it can&#146;t change. It can change, and the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">New&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;can</FONT> provide the competition to change it. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">New&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;will</FONT> be a disruptive rival with the resources to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">go&nbsp;toe-to-toe&nbsp;with</FONT></FONT> established behemoths to drive competition and innovation that benefits everyone, everywhere. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">That&#146;s what today&#146;s news is about, and that&#146;s why I&#146;m more excited than ever about the difference the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">New&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;will</FONT> make in millions of peoples&#146; lives. I look forward to continuing to make the case for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">New&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;in</FONT> the days and weeks
ahead with all of the key stakeholders! </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">John </P>
