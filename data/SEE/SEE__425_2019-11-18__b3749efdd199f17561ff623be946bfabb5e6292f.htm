STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) today announced that its Board of Directors has named Mike Sievert as Chief Executive Officer, effective May&nbsp;1, 2020. Currently President, Chief Operating Officer and a Board

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The CEO transition is part of the Board&#146;s well-established succession planning process to position the next generation of leadership at <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> to take the Company forward. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;John Legere has had an enormously successful run as CEO. As the architect
of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> strategy and the company&#146;s complete transformation, John has put <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> US in an incredibly strong position. I have the highest respect for his
performance as a manager and as a friend, I am very grateful to him for the time together,&#148; said Tim H&ouml;ttges, Deutsche Telekom CEO, and Chairman of the Board of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> US. &#147;John taught
everyone at <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> that if you listen to customers and empower employees, you can change a culture &#150; and by doing so &#150; change a company and an entire industry. On behalf of the Board of Directors,
I would like to thank John, and of course Mike, and all the employees for everything they have achieved over the past seven years. We have tremendous respect for John&#146;s leadership and appreciate his incredible contributions to <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> success. The Board is pleased that John will support this leadership transition while focusing on closing our pending acquisition of Sprint.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With Legere&#146;s involvement, the Board undertook a comprehensive, multi-year,&nbsp;leadership succession planning process tied to the strategic direction
of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and has chosen Sievert to step into the CEO role next Spring. Sievert has worked alongside Legere for the last seven years, transforming <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> into the
fastest growing wireless provider in the market and ultimately into the tremendously successful <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier.</FONT> As <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> Chief Marketing Officer and then COO,
Sievert led the design and execution of the 16 <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> &#147;moves&#148; that have defined the company and established <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> as the customer satisfaction leader
and most-loved brand in the industry. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Today, in his current role as President and COO, Sievert leads a team of tens of thousands of customer-focused
disruptors and innovators who are changing the rules of wireless every day. He leads all of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> marketing and product groups, and all retail, sales, and customer support groups for all of <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> segments and brands, among other responsibilities. In addition, over the past two years he has worked closely with Legere on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> merger planning,
integration, and regulatory approval initiatives, with the goal of creating the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> by successfully closing the pending acquisition of Sprint. Sievert has also served as a member of the <FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;I hired Mike in 2012 and I have great confidence in him. I have mentored him as he took on increasingly broad responsibilities, and he is absolutely the

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> has been and where it needs to go to remain the most innovative company in the industry. I am extremely proud of the culture and enthusiasm we have built around challenging the status quo and our ongoing
commitment to putting customers first. Together, these attributes have distinguished <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> in the marketplace and on Wall Street, giving us a powerful business advantage that is instilled throughout every
level of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> I am confident it will thrive under Mike&#146;s leadership.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;In the months ahead,
my focus will be on ensuring a smooth leadership transition and continuing to work closely with the Board and Mike to complete the Sprint transaction,&#148; added John Legere. &#147;This merger will create the New
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> &#150; a company that is uniquely positioned to continue disrupting the wireless category &#150; and beyond. This marks the beginning of a dynamic new chapter for
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.&#148;</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;I am very grateful to Tim and the Board for this exciting opportunity to lead <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> into the future,&#148; commented Mike Sievert. &#147;I personally want to thank John for all he has done for me and for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> brand, our customers, employees,
partners, and investors. John is a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-of-a-kind,</FONT></FONT></FONT> visionary leader who has redefined the role of CEO and demonstrated how to use
it to create positive change for customers, employees, and investors alike. I have been fortunate to work together with him to build <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> purpose-driven strategy to address customer pain points, an
approach that has been the foundation for our unprecedented growth.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> culture, which all
our employees live every day, will not change,&#148; continued Mike Sievert. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;T-Mobile</FONT> is not just about one individual. Our company is built around an extraordinarily capable management team and
thousands of talented, committed, and customer-obsessed employees. Going forward, my mission is to build on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> industry-leading reputation for empowering employees to deliver an outstanding
customer experience and to position <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> not only as the leading mobile carrier, but as one of the most admired companies in America.&#148; </P>
