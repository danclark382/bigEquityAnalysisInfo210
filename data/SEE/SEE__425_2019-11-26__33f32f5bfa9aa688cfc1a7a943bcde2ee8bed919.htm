following is an excerpted transcript from Sprint&#146;s Town Hall 2Q19 Video Replay: </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Michel Combes: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have had some great news last months. The FCC voted to approve our merger with T-Mobile, as you all know. And just yesterday, as if they knew that our Town
Hall today, they issued their final order. So which is really a great milestone and a great achievement. Not new news, but always when it comes that is great. We are still working hard to settle the lawsuit filed by the general attorneys from 15
states plus the District of Columbia who are opposing the merger, as you know. And if we cannot settle, the trial is scheduled to start December 9. All of our depositions for this trial are now complete and we are working very hard with Marcelo, who
is really leading the charge in that space and the T-Mobile team in order on one side to prepare the trial and on the other side still to figure out whether we could settle this case before the trial. The good news is that we are making some
progress as you have seen. Florida joined the DOJ in supporting the merger, so which is a big state. That was a big move that was expected, but that is great now to have Florida on our side. Mississippi, which recently jumped out of the lawsuit, so
which is good. They were against and they have just decided to drop out. And Colorado is probably our favorite because not only they dropped, but they joined us so they decided to drop from the case and to join us in order to support our case to
join DOJ consent decree. So of course as you can expect, we continue to fight every single day and every single minute in order to figure out whether we can convince some other states to join us. We have, as you all know, a very strong case and that
helps us to educate the opposition on the merits of the transaction. So do I hope that some other states will join? The answer is yes. Do I know whether they will join the answer is no. So meaning that it is really an everyday fight. We have a few
weeks before the trial in order to try to settle but you can still settle during the trial and you can even settle after the trial, so which means that we are going to continue in parallel the settlement work on side and the trial preparation and
the trial on the other side. Do I still remain confident that we will win and that our case will prevail? The answer is yes. I have never been as convinced by our case but, of course, I&#146;m not the only one to be convinced. We have to make sure
the ones which are going to judge our case are going to be convinced as well and so that is what we are doing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Michel Combes: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So there was a question on I thought the merger was approved in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-October,</FONT> so why was it just official yesterday for
the FCC? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Jorge Gracia: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">That&#146;s the FCC
question. Three commissioners of the five voted in favor of the merger in October. So although it was technically approved, the official FCC order stating that the merger is in the public interest, which is the standard they have to meet to support
the merger, was issued yesterday or the day before. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Michel Combes: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is another question which is related, let&#146;s say, to the process which is please describe the process of the antitrust trial and how long you
anticipate the trial taking in case there is a trial. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Jorge Gracia: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Right. So, first off, you know, there are two proceedings going on. One is more of a procedural matter to satisfy antitrust concerns. That&#146;s in the
District of Columbia and that is moving apace, we&#146;re not focusing on that. I think the question pertains to the State AG trial, which is scheduled to start December 9th in the </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Southern District of New York. The trial is currently scheduled for two weeks with a one week buffer after that, which brings us to our around December 23rd. The judge has discretion to change
the start date of the trial, the timing of the trial and how it proceeds. So this is a bit of a guess at this stage. What will happen starting December&nbsp;9 is that the states will give an opening statement. They will put on, so will the
defendants in this case Sprint T-Mobile, DT and SoftBank, various witnesses including potentially Michel and other members of the Senior Leadership Team, Marcelo is likely to be called as well as members of the senior leadership teams from the
various other parties. Then experts will be put on and these are principally economist who are going to testify on one side or the other regarding the, you know, the economic benefits of the merger, Sprint&#146;s prospects as a standalone entity and
whether the merged entity will have an economic incentive to meet the commitments it has made principally around lowering prices for consumers. After that there will be a post trial briefing period that we expect will end sometime in the middle of
January. Thereafter, depending on the judge&#146;s calendar, we expect based on the history and deciding cases to have a decision by sometime in February. You know, if we prevail, depending on whether the judge issues a stay, meaning something akin
to an injunction, which would prevent us from closing we would proceed to closing as quickly as possible. If God forbid we do not prevail in the litigation there will be a discussion among the parties about next steps. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Michel Combes: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have wireline, we have customers which
have to take decisions on whether they are going to shift their business from a wireline perspective to us or AT&amp;T or Verizon. It&#146;s fair to say that when they take this decision, and it&#146;s a decision which is going to impact the next
coming years for them. It&#146;s not something that they can do on a month and then decide, let&#146;s say, to shift it back the months after. That&#146;s a decision, which will impact the next 3-5 years from then. And it&#146;s fair to say that
they don&#146;t know exactly who they are really entering in contract with because they know that Sprint is extremely keen and active in that space. T-Mo a little bit less. T-Mo has said that they will be, but nevertheless there&#146;s a kind of
unknown. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Jorge: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Thanks. Question is, how often can
we expect updates during the merger trial? I think you will get real-time updates because the press will be we expect&#133; [Laughing] </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Very keenly
interested in the daily progress and the testimony, rulings the judge might make on evidentiary matters. I think the parties, including Sprint, have to be careful about what we say. We want to avoid, you know, antagonizing the judge or saying
something that&#146;s inappropriate with respect to our perception of how the trial is preceding. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Deeanne King: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The only other thing I would add is, from a communication perspective we&#146;re working really closely with the T-Mobile corpcom function as well and so you
can expect regular updates either, you know, whether it&#146;s weekly or if there&#146;s something material. But also talk to your leaders because we will be making sure we arm our leaders with information that they should be and can be sharing with
all of you. So, you will be, as Jorge said, I think have access to a lot of information there. Any questions in here? We going to keep going down the list. Oh, you&#146;ve got one. Alright,. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Hey, guys. I&#146;m Nick. I&#146;m a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">B-to-B</FONT></FONT> rep in the South Jersey market. Is
there anything you can share with us about T-Mobile&#146;s sales culture compared to ours? Is there any glaring similarities, any glaring differences between them and us? </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Speaker: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yeah, well, I think we are well ahead of them,
right. They try to catch up and the longer the merger drags out maybe they have a chance, but I don&#146;t really believe so. So no, look they are very strong in business and retail so they sell a lot more than we do. We are catching up, but they
are much better there. On the other side, we are much better in the enterprise field. We have a much stronger sales force in the SMB, in the large SMB field. We have a much better understanding what of our customer needs because the portfolio that
we offer to our customers is much broader. So, I think we are in a superior position here and we are prepared for the merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Dow Draper: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I would say, I would add to that on the retail side one of the things they&#146;ve said is that they respect how hard our folks work and think that we will
actually bring another level of, you know, effort and intensity to their group. So, excited about that. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Andrew: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And another question, which is interesting because it suggests a slight confusion about the status already. So if the judge in the merger says no, do we get
prepaid back? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Speaker: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We don&#146;t because it
never left. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Andrew: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">That&#146;s my point,
we&#146;ve still got it, right. It hadn&#146;t left us yet. And actually just to be clear, you know, our Q2 results that we just announced, you know, included within that, you know, the prepaid results, which actually are, in isolation, quite strong
year on year, right. I mean, prepaid is growing. So prepaid never leaves if the merger doesn&#146;t get approved. So John, there&#146;s a couple more network questions there. You&#146;re a popular guy today </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Saw: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also looking at expanding to other
markets. A lot of it comes to where we are with the merger in a couple of weeks. Obviously we believe that, you know, if the merger is approved we&#146;re going to be much better off building an even bigger footprint nationwide together with
T-Mobile. And, you know, T-Mobile and us have very complementary assets. We are building what we have on 2.5, they are building on 600. It makes a lot of sense for us to actually combine the two. So if the merger gets approved we will obviously
build it together with T-Mobile. If not, we&#146;ll continue to invest in 2.5 and expand in bigger footprints. Okay? </P>
