<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This morning, we shared some important news about the future of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> Mike Sievert has been selected to succeed me
and step into the role here at <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> on May&nbsp;1, 2020. I plan to continue in my role as CEO through the end of April. And during that time, I will focus on a smooth leadership transition and the
ownership and completion of our successful merger with Sprint to become the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is also important to note that this succession news changes nothing in our plans to combine with Sprint and form the New
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> When our merger with Sprint closes Mike will have the opportunity to supercharge the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> strategy. We are not done yet, not by a long shot. This will be
the start of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> next chapter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the exciting CEO succession news, I&#146;m also pleased to share that Neville Ray is now our President of Technology, which acknowledges his
incredible accomplishments and the critical role that he will play in building of the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> with the amazing 5G network that we will deliver to consumers across the country. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;m also pleased to share that CFO, Braxton Carter, has &#150; will be extending his contract to stay on with
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> through at least July&nbsp;1 of 2020. He&#146;s an invaluable asset to the company and he will be here to help with Mike&#146;s transition and the merger close with Sprint. </P>

by the state AGs a couple of weeks ago? And any update on a merger agreement with Sprint? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes. Thank you for the question. I think both Mike and I can handle that. The New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> 1.0 was extremely well received, certainly by first responders and families that are hoping to have ways for their children to do their homework as well as people who were worried about the low end of the
market. I mean there&#146;s some dramatic news there. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Secondly, the fact that we&#146;re already announcing and doing disruptive
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> moves for the company that doesn&#146;t yet exist, was very well received. I&#146;ve shared that coming news with each of the attorneys general, and it was well received. These are areas that
they&#146;re all quite strongly interested in, i.e., now we&#146;re continuing to have very good dialogue with them. In fact, dialogue on &#151; with many constituents that&#146;s long overdue has continued. I&#146;ve actually had some fascinating
dialogue in the last week with heads of labor who are learning more about the jobs picture here and seeing if there&#146;s ways for us to build bridges. So who knows? All these ships might just merge in the right direction. But I feel quite good
that we have the basis for settling this deal, and I feel equally as good, if not better, on our ability to in this case in a trial, so we&#146;re certainly a very good spot. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You may have picked up any newspaper in the country yesterday and saw a very simple subtle <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">1-page</FONT> letter from me to
consumers just trying to outline what the benefits of the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> are around 5G in rural America and on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband and on jobs and prices, and what are some
of the things that you can expect if it doesn&#146;t happen. So I think the dialogue is grown now. The dialogue is now quickly becoming us, the attorneys general, of course, the FCC and the DOJ are still very strongly interested. It&#146;s now
involving consumers at all levels. So when you look at them from that standpoint, let&#146;s see. Maybe we can get this thing wrapped up sooner rather than later. But yes, it&#146;s well received. Thank you for the question. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Philip A. Cusick </B>- JP Morgan Chase&nbsp;&amp; Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes. Full page on the <I>Times</I> was very subtle. And any update on that merger agreement? </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The &#150; so the long-stop
discussions with the other party is going well. There were actually shareholder level meetings in the &#150; during the weekend. And I don&#146;t have anything to announce, but there&#146;s certainly progress. There&#146;s been multiple discussions.
There certainly is an intention to find a way to solve that and move forward. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As I said, the last sets of discussions were at the shareholder level over
the weekend and we&#146;ll keep you posted on that, but I &#150; that&#146;s not slowing down any of our progress on the deal, but it&#146;s certainly an area that we&#146;d like to get completed as soon as possible. And if we had that to announce
for you today, we would, but stay tuned. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I was just curious if you could speak a bit to the timing of why today for the announcement, but also the timing as you look at the sequencing of the
different staggered horizons for different executives to move up to move on. And also, within that context, can you talk a little bit also about how you&#146;re looking to continue to keep grooming the management base over time? </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes. Okay. There&#146;s a few things. First of all, the timing of Mike and I has been in the works since 2012. I mean, certainly, from the work that I do with
the Board, and as you know, I&#146;m very happy with my tenure at <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> I think it&#146;s going to get even better in the months that are left. But a CEO with a Board that doesn&#146;t have a good
succession plan fails. And we work very, very hard, not just on the succession of the CEO, but I would argue that we&#146;ve got 15 years&#146; worth of leadership at our table that is better than anything anybody in this industry or others has.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So the timing, as to why now, the timing was always expected to be now, but we always expected for the New
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> to exist about 6 months ago, and that was kind of the timing. It&#146;s Mike&#146;s time. We know that. He&#146;s ready. He is at the perfect point. He&#146;s done all the work. It&#146;s time for him
to lead. And I would also say this. It &#150; going into trial, possibly, we also understood that in trying to find weaknesses of the story that we&#146;re telling, one of the things people would say is, &#147;Oh well, John&#146;s contract ends in
April. How do we know who&#146;s coming in? Maybe it&#146;s going to be somebody who doesn&#146;t believe in anything. How do we know the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> strategy is going to continue?&#148; And these are important
components of why this deal should be approved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So you&#146;ve seen a few things at once, right? One, you saw the New
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> 1.0, which made it very clear, and we just saw 2.0. No, the second that John&#146;s done, Mike Sievert&#146;s coming in, and he not only believes and
supports, he jointly <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">hand-in-hand</FONT></FONT> created and architected all of these <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> moves. So that&#146;s the why now. Trial starts
December 9. We want that done before then. We think it&#146;s a pertinent fact. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And the rest of this timing and moving, it does seem every now and then
that we have an announcement to make about another executive. Well, what that is, is every part of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> continues to see, no, it&#146;s not just time to go. Braxton&#146;s got more work to do.
Neville&#146;s got more work to do, and the team loves it here, and we do focus very, very hard on development and execution of the team beneath, and Mike&#146;s done a great part of that work. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Richard Hamilton Prentiss - Raymond
James&nbsp;&amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division&#151;Head of Telecommunication Services Equity Research </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sure. And then the business combination
agreement, back to Phil&#146;s question, any thought about when we might get a resolution on that? I know you said as soon as possible. Is that something hours, days or weeks away? What kind of timeframe do you think we should be thinking of? </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Well, the shareholders are working on
it as we speak. It&#146;s not &#150; I say it&#146;s going well and certainly, if it&#146;s going extremely well, it would be papered and moved forward. I can&#146;t give you a timeframe. We are endeavoring for that to be discussed as soon as
possible and it obviously is covering all of the areas that you&#146;ve all speculated, so you &#150; we just got to stay tuned on that. But again, I want to reiterate that the parties, at the shareholder level as well, are engaged and totally
focused on doing this at the time that they are focused together on closing this transaction. So it&#146;s had its moments, but we&#146;ll get there. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Mike, obviously, you guys are &#150; want to get this deal done and hopeful for negotiations, but like stuff happens, right? And if you lose the case and the
deal doesn&#146;t happen, what&#146;s your plan B for how you operate without Sprint? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Michael Sievert - President&nbsp;&amp; COO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes, of course. Well, look, first, to the premise of your question, we&#146;re planning to win, as you know, and we&#146;re feeling increasingly confident as
we get closer to the trial for a number of reasons. So we&#146;re ready. There&#146;s still another almost a month left. So assuming the trial goes forward, we&#146;re ready. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But to your question, look, we&#146;re a great company. We entered into this because we saw a massive opportunity to unlock huge synergies and create
experiences for consumers that wouldn&#146;t exist in this country without this merger, but not because we needed it. We chased this merger because we felt it was an incredible opportunity, and it is. So we&#146;re a strong company. We would return
right away to the strategy that&#146;s familiar, including stock buybacks, including looking into the marketplace to see if there are other opportunities for spectrum and growing our company with a focus on balancing growth and profitability. Beyond
that, we&#146;ve spent some time on it, but I&#146;d rather surprise our competitors with our game plan. But &#151; look, our focus as I think you know from all of our comments over the past 18 months, is on getting this deal done and building this
new company, unlocking this massive capacity on the network and the massive synergies that follow from that capacity expansion. </P>
