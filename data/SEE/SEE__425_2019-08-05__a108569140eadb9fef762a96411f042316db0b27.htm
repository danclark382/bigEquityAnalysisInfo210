<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PRESENTATION </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;m sure you all saw the
headlines out of the Department of Justice today that we took a huge step forward in our efforts to gain regulatory approval for the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> by entering into a consent decree with the DOJ and by
announcing several agreements with DISH. Let me just take a moment and give you a little color on this truly monumental news. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">First, the consent decree
with the DOJ removes a huge hurdle for this merger to proceed while delivering on the key benefits of the merger that we announced in April 2018. We are going to create a bigger and bolder competitor with a transformative 5G network while delivering
an unprecedented $43&nbsp;billion in synergies. It&#146;s important to point out that the target synergies, profitability and long-term cash generation have not changed for the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> I want to say that
while this process took longer than we had hoped, our goal was to ensure that the DOJ&#146;s concerns were addressed and make sure that we still deliver on every aspect of the synergies we promised to unlock, and we did just that. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;ve been spending a lot of my time in Washington, D.C., and I want to personally thank the teams at the DOJ and the FCC. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also announced today that we have reached agreements with DISH to divest all of Sprint&#146;s prepaid businesses at close, including Boost Mobile, Virgin
Mobile and Sprint-branded prepaid customers, as well as Sprint&#146;s 800 megahertz spectrum licenses after a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">3-year</FONT> period for aggregate proceeds of $5&nbsp;billion. Importantly, we are going to keep
Sprint&#146;s entire 2.5 gigahertz and PCS spectrum, which is so important for fully realizing the 5G efficiencies promised by the merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally,
upon the closing of the divestiture transaction, New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> will enter into commercial arrangements that will support the transferred prepaid customers and provide DISH wireless customers access to the New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> network for 7 years. DISH will also have an option to take on leases for certain cell sites and retail locations that are decommissioned by the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> and both
parties agreed to discuss how we would get access to some or all of their 600 spectrum to use on our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> network. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The transaction with DISH are contingent upon the successful closing of our merger with Sprint. Now this is an incredibly important step forward for the New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> We&#146;re ready to bring this supercharged <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> to consumers and businesses across the country, and this milestone brings us much closer to making that vision
a reality for customers everywhere. </P> <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a reminder, we already got approval from CFIUS and Team Telecom back in December, and we have received
favorable outcomes from 18 of the 19 required state utility commissions, with only the California PUC still outstanding. Very importantly, our commitments to the FCC have resulted in statements of support for our merger by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, and
Commissioners Carr and O&#146;Rielly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These commitments include: covering 97% of the U.S. population with 5G in 3 years; and 99% in 6 years; leveraging
our 5G network to offer a fast and reliable alternative for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband, including in rural America where it&#146;s most needed; divesting Sprint&#146;s Boost prepaid business to a serious and credible
buyer; and in addition, we affirmed the pricing commitment that ensures the same or better rate plan for the first 3 years following the merger. We remain confident and optimistic about the remaining regulatory steps. We are continuing to work the
process with the California PUC and continue to be willing to engage with state AGs who have weighed in on both sides of this transaction, including the state AGs that are party to the recently filed lawsuit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The completion of our merger with Sprint remains subject to the remaining regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We expect to receive
final federal regulatory approval in Q3 and currently anticipate that the merger will be permitted to close in the second half of 2019. Our goal has remained consistent throughout, to continue to share the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pro-consumer</FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pro-competitive</FONT> benefits of this deal with the American consumer. </P>

FCC millimeter wave auctions in which we spent $842&nbsp;million to more than quadruple our average nationwide millimeter wave holdings. We think this spectrum will be a critical ingredient in the 5G layer cake, combining wide channels of <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-</FONT> and high-band spectrum will be a key differentiator for New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> </P>

that we&#146;ll be able to create a future that is even more exciting for American consumers everywhere, and we&#146;re pleased with the agreements announced today. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Brett Feldman</B> - Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Congratulations on the news today. Two quick questions about the deal. The first, it looks like DISH
has proposed new buildout conditions on their existing spectrum with the FCC. I&#146;m curious whether any element of your agreement with DISH is contingent on them actually getting those modifications? And then the second is, do you intend to
support the Sprint MVNO agreement with Altice on the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> network? </P> <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Start. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert - President&nbsp;&amp; COO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sure. And Brett, I&#146;m not sure I understood your question about what&#146;s contingent upon the DISH buildouts. Maybe you could go back to it. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Obviously, part of this arrangement is that DISH has new requirements placed on them to build out against the spectrum by the FCC and the DOJ. They&#146;re a
party to this consent decree. And I think that&#146;s really great news for consumers that they&#146;re going to get after building out a network using all that spectrum. That entire arrangement was and is contingent upon this announcement that was
made today. Is that what you were asking? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Brett Feldman</B> - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">That&#146;s &#151; you answered the question. Thank you. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I might just say on that, too, Mike.
DISH&#146;s press release and their filings were very comprehensive. So if you get a chance to look through those. One of the ways I look at this is if you look at the full utilization of the 2.5 that we&#146;re acquiring from Sprint as well as the
unused spectrum of DISH, this is a great day for American networks. It&#146;d be about 150 megahertz at least of spectrum that will now be put to use that, before these sets of agreements, were not going to be. And certainly, DISH&#146;s
commitments, which have penalties associated with them, are a big part of it. So I&#146;d read those filings and certainly, DISH can comment on those. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert - President&nbsp;&amp; COO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And Brett, your
second question was about the Altice arrangement, yes, all of the existing MVNO agreements from both companies are going to be inherited by the new company, and we&#146;re really pleased to support all those. So they&#146;ll carry forward. We
won&#146;t be killing or canceling any MVNO deals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And one of the things we&#146;ve said all along is that this new company is a bigger friend to MVNOs
than the standalones. I mean the massive capacity that we are creating with this new network creates the incentive for us to want to be a provider to MVNOs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Now those arrangements, each have different durations and they have different pricing aspects to them, we&#146;ll just carry those forward through to their
expirations. And then, obviously, a piece of this is that there will be an opportunity for them to go forward throughout the 7 years. </P> <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes. And we&#146;ve said throughout the process, too, when you invest in the network and you have an eightfold increase in capacity, you have a stadium
that&#146;s got a lot of empty seats, and we are &#151; we therefore cherish the relationships with MVNOs as a way to have the utilization on our network continue. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And there&#146;s been questions already today, I can tell you that the agreements that we&#146;ve struck at our current network are easily handled with a
small percentage of our network. And as the network grows over the next 3 years, they become a de minimis part of our overall broad network capability. And we&#146;re very careful about that. Everything we&#146;ve done, everything we&#146;ve
negotiated has been hinged around ensuring that the build commitments that we&#146;ve made to the FCC and to the country can be attained. And I can reinforce strongly that that&#146;s the case. </P>

Telco&nbsp;&amp; Pay TV Analyst </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Congratulations on the news today. My question is about the MVNO agreement. John, I did read the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">8-K</FONT> that came out at DISH. Was there anything else you could tell us in regard to a couple areas of that MVNO? First of all, it mentions a phase approach for both the MVNO and MNO. So what that&#146;s referring to?
Anything regarding sort of pricing or the percentage of capacity, which you were just referring to? And then a little later in the document, it talks about restrictions on DISH&#146;s ability to wholesale or bundle that service. Just specifically,
is that &#151; are those restrictions related to cable companies? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes, John, we&#146;re going to carefully wade through some of these answers. And it&#146;s not to be evasive. It&#146;s only that we&#146;re only able to
speak today about items that were part of the filings that people have made in the last 2 hours. And it&#146;s unclear how much of that is actually covered. We won&#146;t be discussing pricing on the MVNO. We won&#146;t be discussing in too much
detail any of the restrictions, only to reinforce that we&#146;re very comfortable with the pricing and its accretive effect to our business and that the protections associated with it, again, are part of what&#146;s necessary for us to make sure
that we move forward with the real ambition that we have. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But I don&#146;t know, Mike, do you want to comment on any of the other piece? </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes. Only to agree with what you just said. A couple of things. One is, yes, this is a complex arrangement that&#146;s going to be in place for 7 years. So we
really had to design it carefully to meet the needs of everybody involved. It definitely does great work to set up DISH to enable their use of all that spectrum to enable them while they&#146;re building a network and to give them a very competitive
access to our nationwide network, to your question in 2 forms, through a nationwide MVNO and unlike other MVNOs, as they build out their own network to be able to access ours through a roaming arrangement as well. So that&#146;s a terrific
enablement for them as a new competitor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the other hand, it&#146;s also designed to make sure that there&#146;s nothing in it that thwarts our ability
to meet the commitments that we&#146;ve made to the FCC and to our investors about building out and leading the 5G revolution in this country. So we&#146;re very excited about what we&#146;re able to do. As Braxton pointed out, every aspect of our
business plan and our synergy plan is intact because we&#146;ve designed these agreements to do that. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As John said, this is also an arrangement that will
be accretive to our business because the pricing allows us to monetize DISH&#146;s access of our network. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You asked about capacity. I&#146;ll just tell
you that the arrangement has been designed with certain safeguards to make sure that <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> commitments that we&#146;ve made around the amount of capacity that we will have out there for our customers
is in place. Our customers will be able to experience nationwide speeds for 99% of Americans in excess of 100 megabits per second. Every aspect of the commitments that we&#146;ve made to the FCC are still our plan and have been safeguarded with the
arrangement that we&#146;ve made with DISH. At the same time, it enables them to be a competitor and to pursue a very, very ambitious growth plan. So we&#146;re pleased with that. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes. And John, I&#146;m not usually
the one, especially in the last year, I&#146;ve been rather quiet, to be positive on others&#146; capability. But I would say, it&#146;s very clear that with the spectrum that DISH has, with the acquisition of Boost, with the MVNO arrangement, that
the transition services agreement while they build out their network, with the ability to get some of the decommissioned towers and stores, DISH has a real significant opportunity to be a very credible disruptive fourth wireless carrier. And that
certainly is something that I&#146;m sure AT&amp;T and Verizon should keep an eye on. But it&#146;s not to the detriment of our ability to achieve our ambitions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So &#151; but I do see them having all of the tools in the toolkit, including, from what I see and hear and watch, the motivation as a company, and Charlie
himself, to really become a disruptive player. </P> <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS </P>

questions. So what agreements, if any, are in place now on whether the deal will close or not during state litigation? And John, if you could just tell me a little bit more about how this came together when you first talked to Charlie about putting
this together potentially? I think you&#146;d said earlier in the year that &#151; well, you had some choice words for DISH and what it was doing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Do you and Sprint have any agreements in
place with the state plaintiffs, this &#151; the Democratic state AGs, to either close or not close while the litigation&#146;s ongoing? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert
- President&nbsp;&amp; COO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I see. Right. No. No, our intention is not to close while the litigation is ongoing. So we&#146;ve agreed &#151; made a
set of agreements with plaintiffs around how the trial will proceed and when it will proceed. There&#146;s another proceeding next week where we&#146;ll be meeting with the judge. So that process is unfolding. But no, we don&#146;t have an intention
to close while it&#146;s pending. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes. And Drew, we certainly have had conversations with many of the states involved. I think it&#146;s very important for people to understand that the suit
filed by the attorney generals happened before the knowledge of the actions that the DOJ were going to take, which certainly will solve many, if not all, of their concerns came out. So today&#146;s information is very pertinent input to them, and
we&#146;ll be working very closely with them. Before their suit, we had already started working quite aggressively with many states on what are the things that are important to you and to your state. And frankly, they have urged us to continue that
process even up through now. So that will be next course of business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;m very confident that what we&#146;re going to do, especially if you think
of some of the big concerns that they had. For example, with today&#146;s announcement, there is no consolidation of share in the prepaid industry, which was a big concern of theirs. And then the buildout commitments are very important to many
states, and they want to understand what&#146;s important to them, this lifeline issue. So we&#146;ll continue those conversations. </P> <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And I&#146;m very confident that we will find what is necessary for them to join in. As you probably also
saw, a number of state attorney generals joined as party to this DOJ action today, which is just a start. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As far as the conversations go, you know we
know DISH and have for years. So there&#146;s not really ever a start to conversations with DISH. We&#146;ve had conversations before. We had conversations just in passing after the deal was announced. But this process has been one of a tremendous
amount of work, first with the FCC, getting closure, making commitments, and then with the DOJ. And in the DOJ process was where we more rigorously got involved with DISH. And then we had agreements pending with DISH and then had further
conversations with the DOJ, which culminated today. So a long process but very thorough. Somewhat building on each other as each entity had significant things that were important to them. But to have now the 2 main federal agencies after the FCC
files their order, approving and supporting, including the expert agency, I think that&#146;s an unprecedented level of support that bodes very well for ultimately the finalization and approval of this deal and it being permitted to close in the
second half of this year. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert - President&nbsp;&amp; COO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And we&#146;ve not seen examples, anywhere in recent history, where, to John&#146;s point, the expert agencies have weighed in the way the federal agencies
now have where a deal has not ultimately closed, even if there were objections at the state level. So the fact that we now have federal support is a major, major milestone for this deal. </P>

today, Drew. But certainly, the messages we&#146;re going to have to get back to that are important to the constituents are the jobs are going to go up every day in this new company. The prices will not go up, competition will go up, the buildout
will be comprehensive and on time and cover 99%. So those are the messages we have to get back to, and those are the messages that were of concern to many of the states that were party to this. And they can all be answered. </P>

one more question. Just at some point though between you and DISH, you guys went from merger opponents in this proceeding to at least exploring a potential partnership. How did that conversation go? </P>

life brings strange bed fellows. So remember, we&#146;re not partners with DISH here, right? There are things that we&#146;ve agreed to, arrangements and a deal that is mutually beneficial that helps enhance the competition and allows this deal to
go forward. So it&#146;s </P> <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">THOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS </P>

far different than a merger. It&#146;s an agreement to divest to a serious and credible buyer, which DISH was concluded to be. It happened to be simultaneous with other discussions DISH was
having with the FCC that this enhanced. We&#146;ve both made significant commitments with financial penalties around this. And then, of course, we&#146;re going to help support the transition with an MVNO for DISH and a transition services
agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So it&#146;s a business arrangement and one that I think took a long time to get through but we&#146;re quite pleased with, and I&#146;m sure
they are as well. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert -

access to your network means when it comes to DISH?&#148; I&#146;m sure he&#146;s talking about the MVNO deal. &#147;Will it have full access to your 4G and 5G network?&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I don&#146;t know. Neville, do you want to talk about the approach that we&#146;re taking? </P>

and easy on that one. Yes. So DISH and other MVNOs obviously will have access to not just the great LTE network that we have in the ground but the great 5G network that&#146;s coming superfast. So yes, DISH will have full access to 5G capabilities.

Piecyk asked, &#147;There&#146;s also reference to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> in that release to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> possibly leasing 600 megahertz spectrum from DISH. Does this also mean the FCC is
okay if DISH leases spectrum to others?&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the second part, you&#146;ll have to talk to DISH about that. I think there is some flexibility there.
But this is an actually really interesting topic. We weren&#146;t able to conclude it during the talks that led up today, but both parties are interested in this. DISH happens to own 600 megahertz spectrum that they&#146;re not using. They&#146;re
going to be building out against it but it&#146;s going to take them some time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Meanwhile, as John reported today, we have 22&nbsp;million handsets
already on our 600 megahertz spectrum that&#146;s been rolled out to more than 150&nbsp;million POPs already. So it&#146;s a nationwide availability. And so we obviously do have some interest in leasing that from them for a period of time, maybe a
few years, that would help accelerate our network transition from Sprint over to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> So that&#146;s of interest to the parties. We agreed to sit down and roll up our sleeves and talk about it. But there
wasn&#146;t anything that came to conclusion in the agreements that were announced today. </P> <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes, and I think these are questions that will get fully vetted over the coming weeks. There were a lot of &#151; this went on for so long. There were a lot
of rumors and speculations about what might be happening. I think we dispelled one already, which was that we did not divest any of the critical 2.5 spectrum that&#146;s core to our network. So we got that one down. There was a lot of talk about us
doing a network hosting or sharing arrangement with DISH, and we&#146;re not. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">What this simply means is DISH has 600 megahertz spectrum that&#146;s not
being used. And for a period of time, it would sit there and not be used and provide no benefit to customers or value to them. What we&#146;ve agreed to do is see if there&#146;s a mutually agreeable arrangement, price, through which we could lease
on our network for our use, their spectrum, which would be beneficial &#151; it would enhance our network transition process. So this is a &#151; if there&#146;s something that&#146;s good for you and you agree, then you will lease their spectrum
for a period of time at a price that&#146;s beneficial to you and accelerate your ability to do your network migration. That&#146;s all that is. And certainly, it&#146;s almost a who wouldn&#146;t agree to have that conversation? So there&#146;s no
hidden backstop here about us standing up their network for them in this case. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Neville Ray - EVP, CTO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Can I take Bill Ho&#146;s one there? So Bill Ho is asking about millimeter wave. &#147;What are your thoughts of putting your millimeter wave portfolio into
service? What&#146;s the fixed wireless access for you, timing, clearing challenges, if any?&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So just try and tie some of the comments you&#146;ve
heard all through the call today. I mean our goal and ambition with New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is to combine <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-</FONT> and high-band assets
together. That&#146;s always been our story. We think that&#146;s absolutely critical for the type of 5G service that customers can use on a ubiquitous basis, both in urban, suburban and rural environments. And you need all those elements, all of
those pieces of the puzzle to come together the right way. So we had a very successful recent auction outcome primarily on 24 gigahertz. We are already &#151; we have deployed 28 gigahertz. You&#146;ve seen that. We are the first wireless carrier to
put out millimeter wave coverage maps. Pretty exciting what you can see with millimeter wave in Manhattan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But I think everybody understands now that you
cannot take a millimeter wave portfolio across the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">3-plus</FONT> million square miles of the U.S. It just doesn&#146;t work. It&#146;s not economic. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I mean you can absolutely use millimeter wave where there are large concentrations of people, where the population density exists. And that&#146;s always been
part of our plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 24 gigahertz we&#146;ve recently assumed is going to take some time to work through the dialogue on power limits and some other
pieces, but radio needs to come, handsets needs to come. It&#146;s going to take a little bit of time. But clearly, we have assets where we&#146;re already utilizing and deploying bringing 5G service to customers with. </P>

operational plans in every function of this company. And so we&#146;re planning to get out of the gates very quickly and hit the ground running. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some
asked us, well, how is that going to look? And you even have &#151; I&#146;ve got a Tweet here from Roger Cheng asking, &#147;Hey, some are talking about this deal giving some price stabilization. But does that mean that the era of lower rate plans,
aggressive BOGO offers and other perks are over?&#148; in his Tweet? And these are the kinds of questions &#151; and I know he asked it for almost to get this reaction. These are the kind of questions that dumbfound us as management team </P>

leading the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier.</FONT> We are the competition. We&#146;re planning to take these capabilities of enhanced capacity and lower cost and go right after
AT&amp;T and Verizon like they&#146;ve never seen before. I think anybody who supports this merger is going to be very proud of what that looks like in the early months and throughout the entire period. Because we can do that and hit these goals
that we laid out for you last April simultaneously. And that&#146;s because of the unique set of capabilities that we have by bringing these 2 companies together. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You asked the second question about the transfer and how that would work. Think about it this way. Our plan, Neville&#146;s plan for synergy attainment has
always involved, as we laid out for you over a year ago, turning down tens of thousands of cell sites as we integrate these 2 networks into 1 seamless network. And what we&#146;re doing is saying, look, any site that we are planning to abandon
anyway, it&#146;s just in our plan to abandon anyway. That site is something that we&#146;d happily make available to DISH. And we also said there&#146;d be at least 20,000 of those. </P>

of those have assignable leases. If they are assignable, then we&#146;ll happily assign them. If not, we will sort of get out of the way. But it&#146;s a great enablement for a company to move very quickly, and that was certainly the
government&#146;s goal, was to enable DISH to move quickly. But it&#146;s a pretty straightforward thing that involves us getting out of the way on the tens of thousands of sites that we were planning to decommission anyway. </P>

decisions about what we&#146;re going to do about it started several times sitting, testifying in the Senate and Congress and being surrounded by people that were just dumbfoundedly not listening to the fact that jobs are going up and prices will go
down and competition will go up. And if it wasn&#146;t clear to me then it&#146;s painfully clear to me now that we will, early and often, make it clear what the behavior of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> will be post this
transaction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When this transaction closes, we will waste no time making it very clear what this network capability that will going to be built is going
to be used to do, and there&#146;ll be no doubt about it. And it is, as Mike said, it&#146;s a bit dumbfounding to think that we&#146;ve decided to go and build this network and go through this merger so that we can become the basic, lazy, fat, dumb
and arrogant players that we were born to teach how to behave. We want to continue their education in a major way. And that&#146;s core to what we&#146;re going to do with the 5G capability. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Mike, one thing that &#151; on your question on the financial impact, we&#146;ve been very clear, synergies are fully intact; the financial and cash flow
components that we communicated at the beginning of the merger, fully intact. But there&#146;s a silver lining here on the divestiture, and that&#146;s we&#146;re going to have lower gross debt, lower net debt and lower leverage going into <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our current modeling now shows on a reported EBITDA standpoint, max peak leverage of 2.5x. And that&#146;s a
significant improvement by about 0.4 turn of leverage than we would have been, and there&#146;s a couple of factors there. The prepaid divestiture is cash upfront. Certainly, the spectrum piece of it is deferred for 3 years, so that&#146;s not an
immediate impact. But we&#146;ve also significantly over performed at the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> level on cash generation, point to the results of the quarter, just astounding increases in the cash flow of the business. And
all that combined is resulting in a very, very healthy capital structure and leverage profile for the new company, so a real silver lining there. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John
Legere - CEO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes. And I think, Braxton, putting a financial lens on this, I see a few questions already in the lead up when you can &#151; when you
have leaks for 5 months, a lot of people have a lot of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pent-up</FONT> questions. I saw one of them in the last couple of days. When they started to hear that the synergies would be intact and they were trying to
answer how did we shift where the synergies came to keep the synergies intact. And very important to note is the synergies, the $43&nbsp;billion are the same $43&nbsp;billion exactly intact as they were. They were not coming from the areas of the
business that were in this transaction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Another way to think about &#151; so you&#146;ve got the synergies, $43&nbsp;billion, you understand how to
execute against them. Then you&#146;ve got several things. You&#146;ve got a transaction where Boost becomes an MVNO stream to us, which certainly has positive financial implications for us. You have a transaction on spectrum that will either be at
that value or if it doesn&#146;t take place, we&#146;ll have an option later on to sell at that price or to keep it. And you&#146;ve got a &#151; yes, so you&#146;ve got DISH, spectrum and MVNO that are all in and of themselves, positive to the
financials of the company. So I think that&#146;s a very important analysis that Braxton&#146;s pointing out. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Operator </B></P>

COO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sure. Sheila, yes. This whole set of arrangements was designed to be for DISH. And DISH has committed to not only build the network but launch
services in support of that network right away. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In fact, one of their commitments is to launch &#151; not just to support Boost prepaid but to launch
postpaid service. So there&#146;s plenty of robust competition coming from DISH, and it&#146;s been designed to be DISH. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And that&#146;s important for us
because as I said earlier, this has been also simultaneously designed to make sure that there isn&#146;t increased risk to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> being able to live up to its commitments, particularly our commitments to
build this high-capacity network that results in the kinds of speeds and capabilities for our customers that we&#146;ve not only promised our customers but now promised the federal regulatory agencies. And so it&#146;s been designed to have both,
protect our network while enabling the competition. And that doesn&#146;t mean it&#146;s designed for that counterparty to turn around and resell it or to bundle it with other company services, et cetera. It&#146;s to enable them as a competitor.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">That said, we&#146;re interested in wholesaling directly to other parties. As we&#146;ve said all along, this is a company that will be strategically
very aligned with the idea of enabling partnerships with MVNOs, but we will be doing that directly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So this is one of those tricky areas where there hasn&#146;t been enough filing or disclosures on this topic for us to give specific details. So I&#146;ll
stick to details to this. Your initial question is are you concerned. The answer is no. The transaction was defined in a way where we have protected our ability to run our network for the sake of our customers without any potential disruption.
We&#146;ve protected ourselves for this to be for DISH. DISH has been protected in the fact that there are ways for them to raise financial capital, but we don&#146;t fear because there&#146;s tremendous protections for somebody entering a back door
in a way that could be seen to turn this transaction into something other than it is. And the details on that, I&#146;m sure, at some point, will follow. But for today, I can just tell you, those were some of the latest items in the deal, and we
feel very comfortable and all of our concerns were met in how we cut the transaction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">*** </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So I get that there&#146;s no network sharing deal. But I&#146;m curious as to why? Was this a red line for you? It seems to us that the biggest issue in the
court case is going to be how real DISH is and a network sharing deal may have gone a long way to alleviating the concerns that the states have. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I think there are as many opinions as to what the states&#146; issues are that will be going forward. And I have to tell you again, I believe that the
information that the DOJ has come out with today is important input that was not part of the decisions they made when they decided to create the lawsuit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I would also say that we&#146;ve met and spoke with many of the states, and many of the concerns are the same. Originally, there were concerns about
consolidation in the prepaid segment and competition in the low end of the market, especially for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-income</FONT> consumer. There were always concerns on pricing that we have made very strong commitments on,
buildout commitments, state-level buildout commitments that we continue to engage on and jobs, all of which we know are stories that we can answer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Also
on the DISH side, the question of that next marginal thing that would make people feel more comfortable with DISH. I think you need to understand. DISH has a tremendous amount of spectrum and now has a very fortified buildout commitment and a plan
to do so. You have to assume that, that&#146;s going to take place. They&#146;ll have 9.3&nbsp;million customers. They&#146;ll have a tremendous MVNO and a transition services agreement to go along with their other &#151; they have a good marketing
engine and prowess, and they have ability to raise capital. So they&#146;re a real player. Let&#146;s just be clear. Whether another item would make them stronger, those are things that they can do on their own somehow. But DISH is a viable, real,
fourth, facilities-based wireless company at the end of this transaction, and nothing should be taken away from that. I think that will be important input. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I remain very confident that in discussing with the states the things that are of concern to them, we either have answered or can answer them. And that will
be job one as we start to move from here. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Operator </B></P>

question that you&#146;re asking. Obviously, for the entire time that we&#146;ve been working with the DOJ, the staff has been totally involved and detail involved in every piece of what we&#146;ve done. And ultimately, how they get to a decision in
the DOJ is very clear. Ultimately, the staff gives tremendous amounts of input, and then the antitrust head of the DOJ makes a decision based upon all those attributes. But yes, the &#151; every component of the DOJ was greatly, greatly involved in
all aspects of not just discussing this deal, having opinions on it and putting the decisions together. I&#146;m not sure it&#146;s a place where they take a vote, but neither is <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> So I don&#146;t

were true and which ones weren&#146;t. But there were reports early on that the staff remained opposed initially after the FCC resale suggestion. And so I was wondering if the staff had come around to fully agreeing that the current structure of the

could you actually exceed and do better than what your cost to achieve is then if they take on the leases sooner? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert - President&nbsp;&amp;
COO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Braxton? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Braxton Carter - EVP, CFO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes, first of all, we have to support the migration of the Sprint customers to the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> network in a quality
manner, in a way that doesn&#146;t impair and actually delights those customers as they come over on the network. And we&#146;ve previously said that it&#146;s going to take 3 years to get through that process. So there&#146;s very little
opportunity on the cell sites in the early part of this process, so it would be definitely more back ended. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And very perceptive question, absolutely. I
mean, ultimately, and it&#146;s impossible to quantify at this point. But if Charlie does assume some of the lease liabilities, we&#146;ve modeled full payout of the lease liability, and it would be net upside. But there&#146;s no way to really
quantify it or model it at this point. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Well, there&#146;s a way to quantify it. There&#146;s no downside, right? Because importantly, when you sit there and you have a plan, which we have, a very
specific plan for our network migration and certain times at which we will be decommissioning sites and turning them down, and you do or you don&#146;t have transfer rights associated with those but you have visibility into those and you, in effect,
share that visibility. And/or if you&#146;ve got transfer rights, you share that with Charlie. It can&#146;t hurt you. It can help him. </P> <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the retail side, you either have lease transfer rights or you don&#146;t. And if you do, you make those
visible. But it&#146;s all while executing our plan for our synergies exactly the way we&#146;ve outlined them and letting, if possible, DISH get the benefit of some of that, that they need that we will no longer need. And yes, the intersection of
some of those can be a cost benefit to us if, in fact, there is a piece of that would be beneficial for them to take up payments that we have a right to transfer instead of canceling them. So yes, it&#146;s actually a
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">win-win,</FONT> and it will be up to them as to how much of it they choose to take. But there&#146;s no downside. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Ric

you found any concessions that you had to move into the merger? I think there was $7&nbsp;billion of potential concessions included in the merger agreement. It doesn&#146;t look like you&#146;ve had to give up any concessions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert - President&nbsp;&amp; COO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When you say
concessions, I mean, you&#146;re kind of asking about quantification of the impact of this set of divestitures. And as we look at the impact of the set of divestitures as well as the impact of a year of outstanding execution by this company going
into the close, we look at the plan, and as Braxton said very clearly, we see a plan that has every bit of the long-term profits and cash generation and every bit of the EBITDA still intact. And that gives us a lot of confidence that we&#146;ve got
something here that&#146;s got a lot of momentum behind it. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes. And if your question was aiming towards anything associated with the business combination arrangement with Sprint, we have updated that today, and
there&#146;s been disclosures associated with the changes to that. So I think that speaks for itself. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But when you say concessions, concessions in
general can be anything that&#146;s a deviation from what you had anticipated to take place in the transaction. We never anticipated to divest spectrum, for example. And although we get a good price for an optionality, that could be seen as a
concession, et cetera. But we&#146;re quite comfortable with that, and we&#146;ve got a good-forward arrangement with the changes in the BCA as well. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Okay. We&#146;ll take &#151; I think we&#146;ll take 1 or 2 more? Does that make sense with everybody here? Okay, let&#146;s keep going. Operator? </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Two questions, if I may. In the Public Interest Statement last year, you had indicated that it was your goal to reach 9.5&nbsp;million <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband subs by 2024. Just curious if that&#146;s still the expectation. Just some color on your strategies as it relates to the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband. We really
haven&#146;t heard too much about that lately. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And then secondly, I know you&#146;ve reiterated the $43&nbsp;billion in NPV synergies. Just looking back
to your previous disclosures, you mentioned about $4&nbsp;billion coming from network, about $1&nbsp;billion from sales, service and marketing, and another $1&nbsp;billion from back office. Is that still the breakout that we should be expecting?
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere - CEO </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You know it&#146;s interesting,
the Public Interest Statement just sounds like it was 100 years ago and certainly was the fundamental basis through which all these discussions took place. And in a smaller <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ramped-up</FONT> version where the
commitments that we made to the FCC, and when you look at the FCC commitments about coverage and 5G coverage and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband, you&#146;ll see these notes. And Mike... </P>

are yes and yes. I mean yes to the 9.5&nbsp;million and yes to the synergy breakdown, as Braxton was saying, being as we presented it when we launched the deal last April. </P>

that I think there&#146;s incredible excitement about what we can do in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband space, especially in rural environments. I think that&#146;s something that, through the discussions we&#146;ve had
with the FCC and obviously some of the state folks, that&#146;s a huge win from this combination, a transformational impact from this 5G network in rural America and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband space. Super exciting.

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I think the question is a really good one. It&#146;s something that we&#146;re going to have to revamp up our communication about. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you look at the FCC&#146;s decision process and the things that were extremely important to the FCC and to the country about this network build and about
the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband competition, about the rural competition, not just rural coverage but rural <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband, the commitments we made, those are the most exciting
parts of this. But for a number of months, we kind of took a left-hand turn where the DOJ certainly had a different set of issues that they were focusing on and trying to answer the question of can that exciting thing for the country happen without
harming the competitive environment? And &#151; but all the items that are being announced today by the DOJ, as you look past them, then you have to go back and see, okay, this sets the stage for that. And now you start to remember what happens when
you unleash this network, you invest $40&nbsp;billion in 3 years, you increase jobs, you increase rural penetration, you really go after the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband market and attack competitively one of the most
uncompetitive markets in the country. So that&#146;s an exciting piece that I think will now resurface a bit. And together, I&#146;m hoping and believing that those 2 things together now are the answer as to why I believe the regulatory approval
processes from here, focusing on those, I&#146;m confident that we&#146;ll get this done. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let&#146;s take one last question. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I think most of this is probably for Braxton. But Braxton, you&#146;ve got to raise some money to close this deal. So I think you originally had cited
$26&nbsp;billion of investment-grade-rated secured bank debt and bonds. So one, I wanted to confirm that&#146;s still plan? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Two, with regard to timing, a
lot of that needs to be done by the time of the deal close for refinancing. So what is your plan on timing? Had you want to wait until you potentially get through a court process? Or might there be a plan to put the debt &#151; proceeds into escrow
in order to raise it in advance of the close? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Braxton Carter - EVP, CFO </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes, Ana. So first of all, my comment earlier, we&#146;ve got the proceeds from the disposition of the prepaid business as well as outperformance at the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> level in the last 1.5 years since we put the targets out. So we do not need to raise $26&nbsp;billion at this point. </P> <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">What I would just look at as a rule of thumb is about a 10% overall decrease in that or just round it to
$3&nbsp;billion, and then we&#146;ll just determine on market conditions what market that comes out of. Remember, the primary funding mechanisms are term loan B and IG secured bonds. But no, that number is definitely coming down. And I kind of gave
the new entry peak leverage targets earlier in this call. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So the second part of your question, would we prefund some of this versus just really handle it
with the bridge? We will have to ultimately make that determination depending on market terms once we really work through the &#151; in the upcoming months with the states. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I can tell you that the intent is not to draw the bridge. That adds additional costs to the overall funding here. But the actual timing and how we do that
certainly would precede close. Exactly when is yet to be determined, and we&#146;ll have to make a real-time call relating to that. The actual proceeds would be <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-funded</FONT> and would be held in escrow up to
closing of the transaction because we need to attach all the collateral and a lot of details as you are aware of there. But we&#146;ll have to make game day call exactly when and how we&#146;re going to go to market and then what the respective
buckets of what we raised. So &#151; but overall, great news from a credit standpoint. </P> <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P>
