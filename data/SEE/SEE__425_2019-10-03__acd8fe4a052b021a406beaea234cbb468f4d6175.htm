Improve High-Speed Connectivity </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">TALLAHASSEE, Fla.&#151;Attorney General Ashley Moody today announced that she is joining the U.S. Department of
Justice along with 10 other states in support of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> US, Inc. and Sprint Corporation merger. The merger will bring Florida into a new era of high-speed connectivity while protecting Florida consumers
and jobs. Florida&#146;s support is part of an agreement reached earlier this week to address Florida-specific concerns, including concessions to protect Florida jobs and improving infrastructure.&nbsp;That agreement follows a comprehensive review
of the merger by the Attorney General&#146;s Antitrust Division, which reviewed the transaction extensively alongside the DOJ&#146;s Antitrust Division. The DOJ and six other states previously entered into a settlement with <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and Sprint to address certain concerns that existed with the transaction. An additional four states have either joined that action or are otherwise supportive of the merger. The Chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission has formally recommended that the rest of the Commission approve the proposed deal which contains certain commitments determined to be in the public interest. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the agreement, Florida received further state-specific commitments from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> in addition to the substantial
commitments given to the DOJ and FCC. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> has already agreed to freeze its pricing for a period of years and do significant nationwide buildout of 5G service, including over rural areas of the nation and
in Florida. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> has also agreed to divest Sprint&#146;s prepaid cellular business to Dish Network Corp. Dish has committed to enter the market and become a viable facilities-based competitor. The
Agreement will protect hundreds of Florida jobs, ensures coverage and high-speed connectivity throughout the state, and help improve service for Floridians living in rural parts of the state. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Attorney General Ashley Moody&nbsp;said, &#147;Today, we joined with the DOJ and other states in supporting a merger that is a win for all Floridians,
especially those who live in our rural regions. Among other things, Panhandle areas devastated by Michael will have fortified cell towers to better protect communication during and after storms. Our office, along with our federal partners, undertook
an extensive review of the relevant information regarding this proposed transaction, including working to understand their proposed business plan and plans for strategic development for Florida.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2018, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and Sprint announced an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">all-stock</FONT> transaction in which
the two companies would combine. The Office of the Attorney General and the U.S. Department of Justice investigated the proposed merger and sought relevant information from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and Sprint regarding the
companies&#146; business and strategic plans for Florida. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Florida has been one of the states leading this investigation since the beginning, and I am pleased that they have chosen to join our settlement after
