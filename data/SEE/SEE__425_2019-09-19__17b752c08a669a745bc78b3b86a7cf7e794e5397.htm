<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Brett Feldman</B> - <I>Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., Research Division&#151;Equity Analyst</I> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You&#146;ve received federal approvals for your merger with Sprint. So congratulations. Although
you are obviously still contending with the states who are looking to block the deal through a lawsuit. Is there any update that you can give at this point in terms of your engagement with the states? Is there a potential route to a settlement? Or
do you ultimately expect this to be resolved in the court? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert - </B><B><I>President</I></B><B></B><B><I></I></B><B></B><B><I>&nbsp;&amp;
COO</I></B><B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes, Brett. We&#146;re very confident that the deal will close about 3 months ago. So yes, we&#146;re in kind of uncharted territory.
We worked really hard this year to bring about the federal approvals. We&#146;re very pleased with that. We think our story, we&#146;ve been saying since last April, resonated very strongly. Of course, both the FCC commitments that we made and the
DOJ settlement with the consent decree required changes in our plan. But as we very clearly indicated in the Q2 call, the changes that they represented were changes that allowed our business plan, our aspirations and every dollar of our synergies to
remain intact. And so it took a long time to get that done because we were very steadfast in making sure &#151; because we believe so deeply in this plan and that it&#146;s right for consumers and right for the public &#151; that we needed to &#151;
there were certain core principles of it that we needed to hold to, to make sure that not only were those good things preserved for the public but that our business would be intact. And we&#146;re very, very pleased with how all that worked out.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the meantime, a group of state attorneys general sued the deal and now we&#146;re facing that. And of course, that&#146;s an ongoing litigation. We
can&#146;t get into much detail on that. I&#146;ll tell you that we feel very strongly about our case. This is something that from the first day that John and Marcelo launched this deal at the end of April of last year, we&#146;ve been very
confident that this is positive for the economy; that it&#146;s positive for consumers; creates more competition, not less; brings down prices; makes us a better competitor to an entrenched duopoly of AT&amp;T and Verizon. It&#146;s good for jobs,
with net positive jobs at day 1 and every day thereafter and that ultimately, that&#146;s going to be seen by the public and by the decision-makers in this case. Either the state attorneys general themselves, or ultimately, if we go to trial on
December&nbsp;9, by the judge. And it&#146;s a strong case, and we will let the merits of it speak for themselves. But beyond that, since it&#146;s in litigation, I can&#146;t give you too much color on all the ongoing details. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All right. So just to follow up on it from a different angle here, in order to secure that federal approval, you did make a number of concessions. The most
significant, you&#146;re ultimately going </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
to be divesting Sprint&#146;s prepaid business, you&#146;ll be divesting the 800 megahertz spectrum to DISH. And you&#146;re also going to be supporting DISH&#146;s entry into the wireless market
via a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">7-year</FONT> MVNO deal. So the obvious question is, what made you comfortable that the merger still improves your ability to compete and win share and lead in 5G while also enabling what could be a potentially
disruptive new entrant in the form of DISH? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert - </B><B><I>President</I></B><B></B><B><I></I></B><B></B><B><I>&nbsp;&amp; COO</I></B><B>
</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes. I&#146;ll start, and then, Braxton, maybe you can give your perspective. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As I said, we had some core principles that were really important to us, and it took us a long time because we stuck to those principles. We wanted to be able
to come out and be able to share with you that our synergies were intact and our business plan was intact. And remember, the vast majority of the synergies in this deal come from the network side. $26&nbsp;billion of the $43&nbsp;billion comes from
not burdening the American consumer to pay for the fully redundant cost of 2 networks that sit right by each other, but rather to bring those together into 1 larger network that&#146;s much more cost-efficient than with a multiplicative capacity
relative to the 2 standalones. That&#146;s where the majority of the synergies are. That plan is only being enhanced as we &#151; as time goes on and we&#146;re able to plan for it in more detail than we had expected to be able to plan for it in
advance of the close. Look, DISH is going to come in. They&#146;re going to be a viable competitor. On the other hand there are opportunities for us in that competition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">One, we&#146;re a provider to them. We made sure that the arrangement we have with DISH simultaneously accomplishes our goals and theirs. We can monetize the
arrangement in a way that&#146;s attractive for our shareholders through the MVNO deal, but at the same time, we enable them to get going. We&#146;ve never been a company that&#146;s shrunk from competition. We love competition. We thrive on it. We
think competition plays to our strengths because we&#146;re a net share taker. And we&#146;re very confident in our business plan going forward with DISH in it as a viable competitor. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Brett Feldman</B> - <I>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division&#151;Equity Analyst</I> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And Braxton, as Mike just noted, you didn&#146;t have to reduce your view of synergies despite the concession. The network side of it&#146;s fairly clear.
What about the rest? How were you able to identify the same upside to the company even with the concessions you made? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Braxton Carter - </B><B><I>EVP,
CFO</I></B><B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes. First, I will say that we certainly have enabled with these agreements another competitor in the marketplace. That doesn&#146;t
bother us in the least, Brett. You look what we&#146;ve done for the last 7 years. We&#146;ve defined competition in this space, and we&#146;re more than happy to facilitate &#151; Charlie &#151; and I would never bet against Charlie Ergen. I mean
that guy is brilliant. He&#146;s done an amazing job building a company over the years, and he&#146;s parlaying it into an entry into wireless; and he certainly has the wherewithal to do so. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But to get to your basic question, first of all, with the MVNO arrangement, we&#146;re losing the revenue
and the margin associated with the prepaid business of Sprint. But we&#146;re replacing it with a wholesale arrangement. And not to go into specific detail, that is largely an offset, certainly a different type of characterization. But when you look
at the overall economics of the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> it was fairly neutral. Let&#146;s leave it at that. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Secondly, the
disposition of the spectrum. That&#146;s a delayed deal. That 800 megahertz is being utilized by Sprint, and we cannot dispose of that until we get to the point where we&#146;ve migrated all the customers off the Sprint network and shut that network
down. Delayed sale, significant proceeds coming into the company, but not significant proceeds upfront. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You&#146;ve also seen that with the sale of the
prepaid business we reduced the overall amount &#151; our overall demand of our bridge commitment associated with the deal. We&#146;ve taken it from $30&nbsp;billion down to $27&nbsp;billion, 2 factors, the proceeds from the sale of the prepaid and
the significant overperformance of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> over the last 1.5 years has allowed us to do that. We&#146;re hopeful we can still get this deal closed this year, but if we do, in fact, go to litigation, this deal
will not close until early 2020. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And when you look at the underlying foundation of the synergies, nothing that we agreed to in this disposition has
really changed. Remember 2/3 of the synergies are coming from shutting down that duplicate network and the other 1/3 is really coming from back-office: duplicate advertising, duplicate G&amp;A, et cetera, that has really nothing to do with the
dispositions that have been agreed to. That, coupled with how well we&#146;ve done at <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> </P>
