 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Civil Rights Groups Sign Groundbreaking Diversity Agreement with
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> US </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">By National Urban League </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Published 02 PM EDT, Wed Oct 16, 2019 </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NEW YORK (October 15,
2019) &#150; A coalition of civil rights groups today announced an agreement with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> US to expand on its existing nationally-recognized diversity initiatives in a wide range of areas following the
closing of its planned acquisition of Sprint to become the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Memorandum of Understanding, filed
today with the Federal Communications Commission, outlines the proposed New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> plans to create initiatives to improve diversity in the areas of Corporate Governance; Workforce Recruitment and
Retention; Procurement and Entrepreneurship; Wireless Services (including 5G Wireless Services) for Low Income Consumers; and Philanthropy and Community Investment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;The New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> has made serious and significant commitments to diversity and inclusion to win approval of this
transaction,&#148; National Urban League President and CEO Marc H. Morial said. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;T-Mobile</FONT> has made these commitments through this MOU and thus directly to the diverse communities that they serve and are
represented by the multicultural organizations who are party to the MOU. In doing so, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and the Multicultural Organizations acknowledge that 21st-century notions of &#145;public interest, convenience
and necessity&#146; along with &#145;consumer welfare&#146; must include a commitment to diversity and inclusion. This includes spending with diverse suppliers, employing a racially diverse workforce and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">c-suite,</FONT> and increasing employment and service opportunities in areas left behind in the digital revolution. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;21st-century regulators and the elected officials who serve as chief law enforcers are encouraged to examine these commitments and recognize that the
promise of 5G technology can improve education, healthcare, and benefit local economies.&#148; Morial said. &#147;We therefore believe that the transaction that would create the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> with the
commitment to diversity embodied in this MOU, would be in the best interest of the communities we serve.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following national organizations are
signatories to the MOU: National Urban League, National Action Network, Asian Americans Advancing Justice &#150; AAJC, OCA &#150; Asian Pacific American Advocates, League of United Latin American Citizens and UnidosUS. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Companies like <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> who strive to learn, improve, and provide for the needs of their diverse customer base
and enhance diversity within their workforce are the ones with whom we want to work in a global technology environment,&#148; said John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC. &#147;Access is essential
to providing a fair and equitable opportunity for Asian Americans and fellow communities of color to succeed as availability of technology can be the difference between thriving and surviving.&#148; </P>

<Center><DIV STYLE="width:8.5in" align="left">
 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;With this MOU, the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is poised to become an
industry leader when it comes to diversity and inclusion,&#148; said Janet Murgu&iacute;a, UnidosUS President and CEO. &#147;We applaud their commitment and look forward to working with them to fulfill the promise of this agreement.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> MOU contains the &#147;best of the best&#148; practices for the New
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> around diversity and inclusion. Substantively, it addresses every one of the key elements of equal service to all communities: governance, employment, procurement and community engagement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;By taking serious steps to increase diversity among its workforce, improve diversity in the procurement of goods and services, and further enhance its
involvement and investment in organizations serving Asian Pacific American communities, the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is leading the charge to alter long-standing corporate practices that largely neglect or harm our
communities,&#148; Ken Lee, Chief Executive Officer of OCA &#150; Asian Pacific American Advocates. &#147;We commend the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> for their corporate leadership in engaging with our communities to
prioritize diversity and we look forward to working closely with them in this and future endeavors.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The civil rights coalition encourages the
Federal Communications Commission to conclude its review of the public interest benefits of the proposed <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and Sprint merger and approve it so the combined New
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> can definitively launch these enhanced diversity efforts and expansion of service to all communities included in the MOU. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;We are facing a time of deep moral crisis in this country, and leaders of all stripes must do their part to close the equity and opportunity gaps that
have negatively impacted <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-income</FONT> people and members of marginalized communities for too long,&#148; National Action Network President Rev. Al Sharpton said. &#147;Once this transaction is approved, the New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> will implement what is, perhaps, the most game changing MOU in recent history for a telecom company &#151; a move that will set the stage for greater investment in low income areas and communities of color,
and expand the company&#146;s already impressive corporate social responsibility mandate with even greater directives for diversity and inclusion.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The coalition further encourages the State Attorneys General and the merger parties to resolve their litigation in the Southern District of New York in a way
that delivers the consumer benefits of this transaction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, as DISH Network is poised to become one the nation&#146;s largest facilities-based
competitors with a major retail and service footprint in communities of color throughout the country, the coalition encourages the new DISH Network to embrace these diversity principles and, at a minimum, match the commitments made by the leaders of
the wireless industry DISH will join, if the transaction is approved. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The agreement represents a template for the way major corporations should commit to diversity and the
specific actions they will take to make equity and fairness part of their business plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;We are thrilled to join our fellow civil rights
organizations in teaming up with the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> to enhance diversity within the company and expand services to communities of color,&#148; said Sindy Benavides, CEO of LULAC. &#147;We hope that more
companies will follow the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> lead in creating more initiatives to improve diversity within their organizations. We know that minority groups throughout the country help keep businesses like
the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> thriving and we are pleased to see that they are incorporating equity and fairness on behalf of our communities as part of their business plans.&#148; </P>

that includes commitments to diversity and inclusion that are bolder than ever before,&#148; John Legere, CEO of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and CEO of New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> said. &#147;With this
MOU, we have doubled down on ensuring we represent the communities we serve today and will serve as the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> in the future. We are excited for the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT>
to become a reality so we can get to work on delivering these commitments.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Highlights of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT>
diversity commitments as the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> include: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#149; Standing up a national diversity and inclusion council
comprised of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employees</FONT> from diverse groups, including each of the multicultural leadership organizations that are party to the MOU, and other highly esteemed community leaders to facilitate open
communication over the development, monitoring, and evaluation of diversity initiatives and to provide advice to the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> senior executives. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#149; With the help and input of the council, developing and implementing a Diversity Strategic Plan addressing each of the key elements of the MOU and
reflecting best practices in the industry. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#149; Increasing the diversity of its leadership and workforce at all levels including its Board governance,
to reflect the diversity of the communities in which it operates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#149; Making a targeted effort to increase partnerships, business, and procurement
activities with diverse business enterprises in a range of categories such as financial and banking services, advertising, legal services and asset sales. New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> aims to become a member of the Billion
Dollar Roundtable by 2025. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#149; Expanding wireless offerings to low income citizens, underserved minority populations and insular and rural areas, and
to organizations serving these underserved communities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#149; A significant philanthropic investment for institutions serving disadvantaged or
