<P STYLE="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 1px; color: White">Selected Risks &#8226; You may not receive any return on your investment in the notes. You will receive a positive return on your  investment in the notes only if the index appreciates from the initial index level to the final index level. If the  final index level of the index is less than the initial index level, you will receive only the stated principal  amount for each note you hold at maturity.  &#8226; The notes do not pay interest.  &#8226; Your payment at maturity depends on the closing level of the index on a single day. &#8226; The notes are subject to the credit risk of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and Citigroup Inc.  If  Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. defaults on its obligations under the notes and Citigroup Inc.  defaults on its guarantee obligations, you may not receive anything owed to you under the notes. &#8226; Sale of the notes prior to maturity may result in a loss of principal. &#8226; The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange and you may not be able to sell them prior to  maturity. &#8226; The estimated val ue of the notes on the pricing date will be less than the issue price.  For more  information about the estimated value of the notes, see the accompanying preliminary pricing supplement. &#8226; The value of the notes prior to maturity will fluctuate based on many unpredictable factors. &#8226; The issuer and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with you. &#8226; There is uncertainty about the future of 3 - month U.S. dollar LIBOR.  If the Index Administrator determines that 3 - month U.S. dollar LIBOR has been discontinued or is no longer widely relied upon by market participants as a  benchmark interest rate, the Index Administrator may select a successor rate to be substituted for 3 - month U.S.  dollar LIBOR.  In that event, Index performance based on the successor rate may be less favorable than it would  have been based on 3 - month U.S. dollar LIBOR. &#8226; The Index is premised on a particular investment thesis about the relationship between the prevailing interest rate  environment and the relative performance of different sectors of the U.S. equity market.  That investment thesis  may be wrong.  The assumed relationship may not in fact exist, or if it exists it may be too weak to be meaningful.   If the Index&#8217;s investment thesis is wrong or too weak to be meaningful, the  Equity Allocation may perform no better  than, and in fact may materially underperform, any other allocation that could be made among the equity sector  ETFs or the broader market.  The offering of the notes is not an expression of our view about the validity of the  Index&#8217;s investment thesis.  You should form your own independent view about the validity of the Index&#8217;s investment  thesis in connection with your evaluation of the notes.   &#8226; Even if a meaningful relationship exists between the prevailing interest rate environment and the relative  performance of different sectors of the U.S. equity market, the particular rules that make up the Index methodology  may not effectively capitalize on that relationship.  &#8226; The Index only seeks to partially implement its investment thesis.  At any point in time, the Index is likely to have a  significant allocation to the Treasury Futures Allocation and/or the Cash Allocation.  That allocation is intended to  help the Index maintain its volatility target of 5%, and is not in furtherance of its investment thesis.  In fact, because  the U.S. Treasury note futures indices are likely to be adversely affected by rising interest rates, the allocation to  the Treasury Futures Allocation may run counter to the Index&#8217;s investment thesis. &#8226; The Index is likely to significantly underperform the equity markets in a rising equity market, because the Index is  likely to have a significant allocation to the Treasury Futures Allocation and/or Cash Allocation at all times. &#8226; The Index will likely have significant exposure at all times to one of two U.S. Treasury note futures indices.  Each  U.S. Treasury note futures index has limited return potential and significant downside potential, particularly in a  &#8220;Rising&#8221; interest rate environment. &#8226; The excess return deduction and index fee will place a drag on the performance of the Index, offsetting any  appreciation of the U.S. Treasury notes underlying the U.S. Treasury note futures index and the equity sector ETFs  that make up the Equity Allocation, exacerbating any depreciation and causing the level of the Index to decline  steadily if the value of those U.S. Treasury notes and/or equity sector ETFs remains relatively constant. &#8226; The Index was launched on February 20, 2019 and, therefore, has a limited performance history. The above summary of selected risks does not describe all of the risks associated with an investment in the  notes. You should read the preliminary pricing supplement and index supplement for a more complete  description of risks relating to the notes. Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. Guaranteed by Citigroup Inc. Key Features of the Index &#8226; Created by Citigroup Global Markets Limited and launched on February 20, 2019. &#8226; Tracks hypothetical performance of a rules - based investment methodology premised on the idea  that there is a relationship between the prevailing interest rate environment and the relative  performance of different sectors of the U.S. equity and Treasury markets. Seeks to implement the  thesis that the  energy ,  financials and  information technology  sectors may outperform the  broader market in rising interest rate environment, and the  utilities ,  consumer staples  and  health care sectors may outperform the broader market in falling or flat interest rate environment. &#8226; Reflects performance of a hypothetical investment portfolio (&#8220; Selected Portfolio &#8221;), adjusted daily,  consisting of hypothetical allocations to three equity sector ETFs (&#8220; Equity Allocation &#8221;), U.S.  Treasury note futures (&#8220; Treasury Futures Allocation &#8221;) and, potentially, uninvested cash (&#8220; Cash  Allocation &#8221;).  Components of the Selected Portfolio are determined daily depending on whether  the prevailing interest rate environment is determined to be &#8220;Rising&#8221; or &#8220;Not Rising&#8221;, as follows: Interest Rate Environment Rising Not Rising Equity Allocation Equity Allocation Energy Select Sector SPDR &#174; Fund (XLE) Utilities Select Sector SPDR &#174; Fund (XLU) Financial Select Sector SPDR &#174; Fund (XLF) Consumer Staples  Select Sector SPDR &#174; Fund (XLP) Technology Select Sector SPDR &#174; Fund (XLK) Health Care Select Sector SPDR &#174; Fund (XLV) Treasury Futures Allocation Treasury Futures Allocation Citi Interest Rate  2Y US Treasury Futures  Market Tracker Index Citi Interest Rate  10Y US Treasury Futures Market  Tracker Index Cash Allocation Cash Allocation &#8226; Identifies prevailing interest environment on each day by observing average rate of 3 - month U.S.  dollar LIBOR for each month in the immediately preceding four months.  If average rate of 3 - month U.S. dollar LIBOR increased from each month to the next in that four - month period, the  interest rate environment will be &#8220; Rising &#8221;.  In all other circumstances, it will be &#8220; Not Rising &#8221;.  &#8226; Determines how much exposure to allocate to each of the Equity Allocation, the Treasury Futures  Allocation and the Cash Allocation on a daily basis in an attempt to maintain a 5% target volatility. &#8226; Allocates exposure between Equity Allocation and Treasury Futures Allocation (together, the  &#8220;Invested Allocation&#8221; ) based on the volatility of the current Equity Allocation over the prior six  months, with higher volatility resulting in a lower Equity Allocation, and vice versa.  Equity  sector ETFs are equally weighted within the Equity Allocation. &#8226; Allocates exposure between the Invested Allocation and the Cash Allocation based on the  volatility of the Invested Allocation over the prior one month.  Will, if necessary, reduce  exposure to the Invested Allocation and increase exposure to the Cash Allocation in an attempt  to maintain a rolling one - month Selected Portfolio volatility of 5%. &#8226; Performance of each U.S. Treasury note futures index is expected to be reduced by an implicit  financing cost.  In addition, a rate equal to the federal funds effective rate will be deducted from  the daily performance of each equity sector ETF.  We refer to this deduction, together with the  implicit financing cost reflected in each U.S. Treasury note futures index, as the &#8220;excess return  deduction&#8221;.  &#8226; Index fee of 0.75% per annum is deducted daily from Index performance.</P>
