<P STYLE="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 1px; color: White">Selected Risk Considerations &#8226; You may lose a significant portion of your investment. If the securities are not automatically  redeemed prior to maturity, your payment at maturity will depend on the final underlying value of  the worst performer on the final valuation date. If the final underlying value of the worst  performer on the final valuation date is less than its final buffer, which means that the worst  performer on the final valuation date has depreciated from its initial underlying value by more  than the buffer percentage, you will lose 1% of the stated principal amount of your securities for  every 1% by which that depreciation exceeds the buffer percentage. &#8226; You will not receive any contingent coupon following any valuation date on which the closing  value of the worst performer on that valuation date is less than its coupon barrier. &#8226; The return on the securities depends solely on the performance of the worst performer. As a  result, t he securities are subject to the risks of each of the  underlyings and will be negatively  affected if any one performs poorly. &#8226; You will be subject to risks relating to the relationship among the  underlyings . The less  correlated the  underlyings , the more likely it is that any one of the  underlyings will perform  poorly over the term of the securities.  All that is necessary for the securities to perform poorly is  for one of the  underlyings to perform poorly. &#8226; The securities may be automatically redeemed prior to maturity, limiting your opportunity to  receive contingent coupons if the worst performer performs in a way that would otherwise be  favorable. &#8226; The securities offer downside exposure, but no upside exposure, to the  underlyings . &#8226; The securities are particularly sensitive to the volatility of the closing values of the  underlyings on or near the valuation dates. &#8226; The securities are unsecured debt securities and are  subject to the credit risk of Citigroup  Global Markets Holdings Inc. and Citigroup Inc.  If Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc.  defaults on its obligations under the securities and Citigroup Inc. defaults on its guarantee  obligations, you may not receive anything owed to you under the securities. &#8226; The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange and you may not be able to sell them  prior to maturity. &#8226; The estimated value of the securities on the pricing date will be less than the issue price.  For  more information about the estimated value of the securities, see the accompanying preliminary  pricing supplement. &#8226; The value of the securities prior to maturity will fluctuate based on many unpredictable factors. &#8226; The  Energy Select Sector SPDR &#174; Fund is subject to concentrated risks associated  with the  energy sector.  &#8226; The SPDR &#174; S&amp;P &#174; Biotech ETF  is subject to risks associated with investing in the biotechnology  sector. &#8226; The SPDR &#174; S&amp;P &#174; Biotech ETF is subject  to risks associated with the health care sector. &#8226; The issuer and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with you. &#8226; The U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities are unclear.
