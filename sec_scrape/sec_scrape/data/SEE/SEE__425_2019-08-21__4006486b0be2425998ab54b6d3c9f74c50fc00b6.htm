<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Michel Combes: </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes! Good. Some of you,
yesterday, were able to join our chairman Marcelo in 62C. I hope most of you were probably there. I hope you enjoyed it. Did you enjoy it, yeah? Good, good, good! It&#146;s always great to hear his perspective, even if it was a little bit short.
Because it was a little crowded in the room. I guess some of you were not completely listening at the back of the room. But that&#146;s fine. It&#146;s always great to hear his perspective on the merger. Since as you know, and what he told you
yesterday, he has been so dedicated to this merge. He was explaining to the ones that were there, that he probably did eight weeks, six or eight trips from Japan to D.C., to Japan to D.C., to Japan to D.C., and I was doing the same but from Kansas,
so it was a little bit easier than from Japan. So that was a bit painful, but I guess in the end it was really worth and it did an amazing job in order to make this decision with DOJ. This process, unfortunately as you know, is taking longer than
any of us could have imagined, but I can assure you that it was worth the wait. So, despite it takes a little more time, it was worth the wait. So, we have to continue the course. The clearance from the DOJ was obviously very important milestone to
merge with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mo,</FONT> combined with the approval from CFIUS that we got already a few months ago, I guess back in January, December. So many months ago. And also, the anticipated approval from the FCC. I really
believe that we are in a clear path moving forward. The DOJ approval has given us &#151; all of us, and I guess for Sprint, but also <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mo,</FONT> a new energy, and I hope everyone has been able to celebrate a little
bit this milestone last week. So, it&#146;s important to take first a moment to consider the amazing future that is ahead of all of us with this merge. As Marcelo said last week in the email that was sent to all the employees, this merger is
critical. It will give us the resources, whether it&#146;s Spectrum or finance, the scale we need to launch an amazing national-wide 5G network with the best prices and services. We&#146;re doing already did quite a great job with our 5G network and
we&#146;ll come back to that with John, but when we put the two companies together, that will be just unbelievable. So to everyone from Sprint that will be part of the new <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> meaning most all of you,
you will have an opportunity to work for Global leader in wireless, for one time to really fight neck to neck with the AT&amp;T and Verizons of this world. And everyone from PrePaid who will be part of Dish, there is also an incredible future for
all of you. You will be part of a new disruptive company that will force the rest of the industry to compete, because obviously the intent is to have Dish plus Boost to leverage the same network and to compete against Metro PCS and the others, to
make sure these markets remain extremely competitive. So, there will be many benefits to combining with Dish, and I guess its great news to bring this opportunity. And already during this interim period you&#146;re running as an independent company.
I mean, not Sprint. Boost is running as an independent company and I will not be able to boss you around anymore, which is probably your favorite part of it, I know that. Very unfortunate for the others, because I will boss even more around,
let&#146;s say in the next coming months. So that will be a new type of balance. But, of course, despite all of that, we are not yet there, as we know. And so, let&#146;s try to talk a little bit about what is next in the next coming weeks and
months. Three members of the FCC have publicly stated support for the merger. So, we expect a full vote of approval from the agency, from the FCC, soon. Meaning probably in the next coming days or two weeks, we will get this clearance from the FCC.
But we could have imagined that after DOJ and FCC we would be done. But I discovered &#151; which was a little bit &#151; which was surprising for someone coming from the outside of the U.S., that even once the federal agencies give you the
clearance, you have other guests around the table. So, it&#146;s not as if you were just with the DOJ and FCC, but some others are showing up. As you know, we have PUCs and we have state AGs. As far as the PUCs are concerned, 18 out of 19 have
already cleared the deal. So, we&#146;re pretty there, also with the PUCs. The only one remaining is California. We&#146;re working on it. And let&#146;s say... I guess that we are quite confident that we will get it as well. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So, let&#146;s speak, the last one, the Texas AG on Thursday made it 14 states and the District of Columbia in opposition to the merger. Do you think it&#146;s
going to stop? <B><U> </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Jorge: </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The short answer is we don&#146;t know. The state coalition that filed the lawsuit to block the transaction is trying to build support. They&#146;re lobbying
other Attorneys General, essentially arguing that if you join us, you&#146;re in a better position than if you don&#146;t. On the flip side, our outreach is focused on getting State Attorneys General to support the merger. So, it remains to be seen.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Michel Combes: </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Okay. Yep... a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So what is their main problem? I mean... [Laughter] [Applause] <B><U> </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Michel Combes: </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I tend to agree with you.
[Applause] <B><U> </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt; Audience Member: </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I don&#146;t understand. I mean, it&#146;s... everything that I have heard is so beneficial for each state and consumers, and I don&#146;t understand where
they&#146;re coming from on this. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt; Michel Combes: </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So we tend to share the same point of view as you. But we have not yet been able to be completely heard or listened about it. No, I guess that the processes
that we went through with the FCC and DOJ, were very good and strong processes. FCC was clear, what was important for FCC was the real build of a 5G network, and so since beginning Chairman Pai has been very transparent. He was looking for making
sure that the commitments that we were taking to reinvest the synergies of the deal in the network were real, and that at the end of the day we would have, in the U.S., the best 5G network, and that would strengthen 5G leadership from the U.S.
compared to the rest of the world. So that&#146;s, I mean it&#146;s natural from (indecipherable), it was very clear from day one, and so that&#146;s why we have worked with him, sharing all the information, and in the end, in order to give even
more comfort, as you know, we have taken some strict commitments, in terms of network roll-outs. So, this is done, so now the U.S. can be proud because there will be 5G network rolled out by new <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT>
which will be amazing and force AT&amp;T and Verizon to do the same, which means the country will be better. DOJ was looking at that with different lenses. They just wanted to be sure that competition would remain and would prevail. And you know
there is always this debate about four players to three players. Even if we said on different occasion, it&#146;s not the right way to look at it, because there is no real four competitors today in the U.S. There are two big guys and two small guys,
which are struggling in order to really fight against the others and you have seen once again results of Verizon or AT&amp;T, how the amount of cash or EBITDA that they are generating on a quarterly basis. But nevertheless, despite that, DOJ wanted
to make sure that competition would remain and that this deal would be <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pro-competition,</FONT> and all the discussions that we have had, at the end, the new remedy which has been imposed to us, which is to dispose of
all <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-paid</FONT> assets, to combine that with Dish, which has already some wireless assets, which had announced its intent to go there, which has proven to be a successful disrupter before, not in
telecommunications but in media, when you look at what they have done with the satellites, they have been very, very strong disrupter of the industry, and so once again, I get it. I understand. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I think you said it well. To your point about, what is their problem, I would point you to the complaint. It&#146;s publicly available. This is the complaint
the State Attorney General filed in federal court in New York to block the transaction. And it&#146;s essentially along the lines of what Michel suggested, the old arguments which we vehemently disagree, that the industry is going from four to three
rather than two to three. The argument about jobs, which we have disproved and made commitments about, job growth going forward. And, you know, the lessening of competition, which we have shown through a kind of metric modeling is actually not going
to happen. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Speaker: </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So I have a
question for you. What happens to the TA restricted stock awards once the merger is completed? Yeah, yeah, I know... it&#146;s an easy question for you. I want you to look good in front of Jorge. <B><U> </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Michel Combes: </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So, you have been a little
bit tough with Jorge, so I have a question for you. What happens to the TA restricted stock awards once the merger is created? Yeah, it&#146;s an easy question for you! I want you to look good in front of Jorge. He did his answer so well! [Laughter]
<B><U> </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Speaker: </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we merge
on closings, Sprint stock will go away and it will be <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> stock, so what will happen immediately &#151; and it happens without you taking any action on your part, is that, you know, all of the outstanding
equity awards will be converted using the exchange ratio into <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> awards. And other than that, all the terms stay the same. So, the vesting schedule and all of that. There is a provision for changes of
control, which this would be, that if you have a term &#151; if you&#146;re terminated after that, within 18 months of closing, that the equity would accelerate. The vesting would accelerate. Does that answer your question, Jorge? <B><U>
</U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Speaker: </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A model of clarity,
yes. Thank you. [Laughter] <B><U> </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Michel Combes: </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When can we expect more leaders to be announced for the new company? But then just to prepare yourself, Deeanne, first to correct me after my answer, and then
the two additional questions, which is: what more can you tell us about jobs and H2Q status in Overland Park, and the second was: with requirements of selling assets to Dish, what other employee groups at Sprint will be made part of the transaction
that has not been spoken about publicly? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Okay. So just on the first one, on the announcement of the management... and yesterday, Marcelo did a bit of
teasing, and I guess he was maybe a little bit of timing, but I will try to tell you what is the intent. I think the intent is to be able to disclose as quickly as we can what will be the new lead team moving forward, meaning at the EVP levels.
Because we believe that it&#146;s important for all of us to know what will be the new management team of this company, which will help you to figure out what will happen moving forward, and to start to have people whom with you can, let&#146;s say
discuss, question, understand what is going to happen. So of course, we have to be two in order to make this announcement, so we are still working with Mike Sebert on the other side just to figure out when we can do that. What I can tell you, is
that it&#146;s nearly done, so meaning that we have a pretty good view of the lead team moving forward first. Second, I can tell you, I always told you it will be well balanced lead team in between Sprint and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> </P>
 <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">3 </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
which is extremely important because let&#146;s say that starts from the lead team in order to make sure we have the right momentum in both companies. And, third, that I expect we&#146;ll be able
to disclose it in the next coming weeks. Of course, it&#146;s always, let&#146;s say, kind of a trade, because the more the merge is postponed, the less it&#146;s easy to announce too early the lead team, but I think we&#146;re there. Now that
it&#146;s done, I wish it to be shared with you as quickly as possible. So that&#146;s for the top, that&#146;s for the EVPs. Then coming forward, I guess probably &#151; not two months later, because as I told you, we still have quite a bit of
important time ahead of us. We&#146;ll try to do the same for the SVPs, which will give you really the total architecture of the group moving forward. So in order to be known, in order to be shared, in order to represent what we intend to do, and
then, of course, as we have always said, for the rest of the company, meaning the VP directors and below, I mean it will take more time in order to be done because we need to really start the integration, so it will be more for day zero
announcements. So that is basically the way it will be done. Have in mind you might think it&#146;s not very comfortable for me to manage a company if we already know what will be the management of the future. I guess its importance that you get it
as quickly as possible, for you to understand where and how you work going forward. That&#146;s why I am advocating that we should do that in the next coming weeks, and I guess that I will be able to share that, let&#146;s say, going forward.
That&#146;s it for these announcements. Deeanne you have other questions, if you want to add anything on what I just said on these points. <B><U> </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Deeanne King: </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">No, I think there&#146;s
still work to be done as far as timing. We&#146;ve talked a lot about timing, and as long as the timing keeps dragging out, obviously, we&#146;ll need more time to figure it out. I want to address &#151; we saw a lot of <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-submitted</FONT> questions and I want to address <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">head-on</FONT> a lot of questions about jobs a lot of questions and concerns about layoffs and then a lot of questions about HQ2. Here
is what I would tell you... our position has not changed. You just heard Jorge talk about the fact that some of the reasons that the AGs are questioning the deal is about jobs. We&#146;ve proven over and over and over this is a growth story. You
heard leaders talk about the fact this is a growth story. We&#146;ve been investing in all of you and things like Days of Learning, Career Charge Up, preparing our partners for the future, with the expectation that we want to make sure you all are
very well-positioned for jobs in the future. So, I hope you all feel that, because it&#146;s a commitment that we have made and it&#146;s an investment we&#146;re making in you, and the plan is absolutely to grow and create more jobs and more
opportunities for all of our people. Now, your job may look different. It may feel a little different. The tools you use every day may be a little different, but, hey, that&#146;s okay. You know, so expect some change. There will be change, but
we&#146;re going to make sure you guys are prepared for it. Fair, Michel? <B><U> </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Michel Combes: </U></B></P>

zero and day one? So, I have told you about the timing, when day zero might occur, meaning either before December, if we were to settle, and most likely after, let&#146;s say, first quarter next year if we were not to settle. So, the question is
Nestor, what happens then? <B><U> </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Nestor Cano: </U></B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Exactly. The plan of record says that there are 30 days between day zero and day one, but it depends when that day zero lands. If it lands at the end of a
quarter, we&#146;re not going to be closing at the end of a quarter, we&#146;re going to be closing at the beginning of the next one, there also commitments. There are IT commitments we have with Dish that we need to fulfill in order that we can
create the new customers in the new <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mo</FONT> network. Then there are a few conditions, that means between zero and one, it may be 60, 90, 120 days. And of course, that&#146;s an eternity, and we can do more things
in between. We&#146;re going to do is, we&#146;re going to keep running the integration. Of course, we have more time. That means we are going to try to do a few more things for the business as usual, but keep running the integration. We&#146;re
going to try to solve some of the problems that we had before. Before you probably remember the zero to 0.5, 1, it was cramped and there were a lot of shortcuts to take. We were going to try to clean this thing in order that the process between zero
and one is smoother. Given we&#146;ll have more time, let&#146;s take advantage of the time and do it correctly. And we will manage capacity that we can also give some of the business as usual more urgent things that we have to do. That&#146;s how
we&#146;re going to be working. I don&#146;t know if it explains the thing, but that&#146;s the message they wanted to give.? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Michel

and we were a bit frustrated with this delay, as all of you and all of us. And he told us, you know what... stay positive. You have a little bit more time. So, try to use this time in order to prepare the merge in the best way. And what he was
saying, I would like to have the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile/Sprint</FONT> merge as an iconic merge case for the future, if we can leverage, as Nestor was saying, the additional weeks that we&#146;re going to have, to make sure that
when we hit day zero, we are already ready. So that&#146;s really about day one, so if we can hit Day one in the best configuration that will be better, because then everyone will see and figure out that we are going to be as competitive as we can
immediately. So that&#146;s what we&#146;re going to do. Of course, meanwhile we&#146;ll continue to manage business as usual, and share that with you. But I guess that the challenge given yesterday by Marcelo was very clear and very refreshing.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U></U></B>I guess it&#146;s &#151; I get it. It&#146;s frustrating not to know. My message to all of you and to the management team is to say, you know
what, we cannot predict this type of stuff, so let&#146;s just be focused on our business, on our execution on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">day-to-day</FONT></FONT> business. We know that it will happen. If it
happens earlier, that would be better. If it happens later, okay, we&#146;ll cope with it. So that&#146;s what we say, because there is nothing, we can really do about that except trying to convince them and figure out how we get there. We know that
in front of a judge, we believe that we have a strong, strong, strong case. So that&#146;s why I&#146;m very confident, but we have uncertainty on the timing. <B><U> </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Michel Combes: </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So I hope we are all on
the same page. If there were any remaining questions, you can always send your questions through email. I&#146;m sure there will be some others moving forward. Be sure when you have a question, just let us know, and we will try to answer in the best
possible manner. We&#146;ll tell you we know, or we don&#146;t and the we&#146;ll figure out how to move forward. Once again, and many of your questions are great questions, but we were discussing that with the board two days ago, it&#146;s
unchartered territory, meaning it has never happened. So, by definition, it&#146;s a little bit difficult to predict. As you know, even in a predictable situation, lawyers are usually not that great at predicting, or they don&#146;t like to predict.
It&#146;s not they aren&#146;t good at predicting, but they don&#146;t like to predict. So, in unchartered territory, they have an excuse to make sure they&#146;re not going to predict anything. Which is the way we have to work moving forward&#133;
We said that we would invest in the network. We have done it and continue to do it despite the merge&#133;. But as I already said, of course, the merge with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is the best outcome, but it&#146;s always
better to have a strong platform in case something would go wrong&#133; But as we talk about and as you know, the opportunity Boost will get merging with Dish, meaning that they will get access to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT>
network which they don&#146;t have today. Today Boost customers don&#146;t even roam on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> network, where Sprint customers are roaming on the network. So, moving forward, with the ability to access this
network through the Dish combine, we can expect to have let say a very strong growth engine for those, let&#146;s say, of our colleagues, which will be working within this area of the company. </P>

that we have talked about the merger, and our Q1 results, I just want to spend the last few minutes talking about what we are going to do next, meaning in the next coming two quarters, now that we know this merge will take a little bit more time.
We, I had a recently, with all my management team an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-site</FONT> meeting, in order to try to think about how we should prioritize our work moving forward, knowing, let&#146;s say, that we were in this new
context. Of course, as we said earlier, with Nestor, there is one thing which doesn&#146;t change, which means our effort on integration will continue. We have a little bit more time, so that might allow us to rethink a few resources if needed for
the business, as usual. But also, as I have mentioned, to double down there in order to make sure that we have the best integration ever in the history of the merge&#133;And depending on if we merge, if it was help, if we don&#146;t merge, it will
be the right platform in order to move forward&#133;So, meaning that we are going to double down there and reignite the search rings, of course, we&#146;ll commit on new sites depending on where we stand in our process of merge&#133;And we&#146;ll
start&#133;as for network, we&#146;ll continue to identify new retail locations. You know we &#151; a little bit stopped that because we want to make sure that we have our model right in terms of sales and because we were, let&#146;s say in a very
short-term vision as we thought that we would merge earlier. But if the merger is delayed, and even after the merge, Sprint will remain for the coming quarters, we need to have the right distribution in place to drive a little bit of growth moving
forward&#133; I really would like Sprint to be recognized as a digital first company, and that is something that we might bring to new <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> moving forward&#133;Because once again, that&#146;s a key
critical asset moving forward, whether we merge or if we wanted to merge with &#151; of course, positioning ourselves in the first scenario. It&#146;s still in digital analytics&#133; We know it has been harder to compete this year and it will even
still be more </P>

difficult to compete moving forward as we are going to wait for the merger&#133;So let me explain what we&#146;re going to do. One, which is just a change of metrics, meaning that we have two
things which are happening. The first one is that due to the merge and the commitment that we have taken with Dish, we are not &#151; our prepaid business is supposed to be managed now on an independent manor within Sprint group&#133;And I have
taken all the faces, so which is good, no, that&#146;s not true. So, to recap, just to be sure we&#146;re all on the same page, because this is a very important period we are in, I want&#133;let&#146;s say first on the merger timing, I guess get
that there is no more questions. Now we need to stay on track with our four priorities and our plan to tackle customer experience, SPS and churn in a context which is not yet widely open, but we can adjust and twist a little bit the way we operate.
And by doing all of that, we will be better positioned for the merge or for any type of scenario moving forward, having in mind that I expect the merge will take place very quickly. <B><U> </U></B></P>

John. How bad does the divesting of some of the spectrum going to hurt the plans of 5G for all? <B><U> </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;John Saw: </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So in the agreement, the spectrum that is planned to be divested is the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">800-megahertz</FONT> spectrum. For stand-alone Sprint,
that&#146;s crucial, because that&#146;s our only lower band spectrum, but for the new <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> for the combined company, it&#146;s not as critical because the new
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> as you know, has a lot more lower band spectrum in 600 megahertz and even unused and 700 megahertz. So, 800 megahertz then becomes less critical. And in the plans, we have submitted to the FCC, the
joint network planning plans, it has no impact on the model we have submitted to the FCC, so I think we&#146;re good. <B><U> </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Michel

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and Sprint to become one network? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;John Saw: </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U></U></B>Well, in the plans we worked on, in the transition plan, it&#146;s a three-year transition. So it&#146;s not going to happen overnight.
We&#146;re going to look at migrating customers over a three-year period. We&#146;re going to be anchored on the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> network, but it also means that we are going to keep some of the Sprint sites. So,
there&#146;s a lot of work to be done in terms if you look at back haul, the sites, making sure that they all have one single common configuration. So, it&#146;s a three-year process. <B><U> </U></B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Well, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> will effectively own the rights to the Sprint brand and will decide to do what it wants to with it from

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is one question which was for Andrew. So maybe I can ask you Nestor, no I&#146;m joking. It&#146;s purely a financial one, which is The Wall Street
Journal reports that if the merger closed after January 2nd, that would mean higher costs, is this a true statement, what are the complications if this is true? So, Andrew has already &#151; Andrew wasn&#146;t able to be here today, but what I can
tell you is that we have&#151; just before entering in the merger discussions, we have raised enough </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
financing for the company. And we took a lot of margin in terms of timing of the transaction. At that stage I was a bit criticized saying I was too cautious in the amounts of money that we put on
the balance sheets in order to keep us on the safe side. I am happy to have done it, meaning that we are in a very strong position from a cash prospective, I was looking to see if Judd was there, which means that I have no concern whatsoever, and so
I don&#146;t know exactly what the Wall Street Journal was alluding to. We have plenty of cash on our balance sheet. We have the ability to operate this company through the merge and we always also the possibility if needed at some stage and I have
always said we will remain tactical to raise a little more money, because at some stage we have to pay down some of the existing debt, so we might substitute part of this debt. So, no concern whatsoever from a financing point of view. We are all
good. Then there is a question which always comes back during our sessions, which is probably also important to tackle, which is, if the merger fails, what happens next? So always, little bit the same answer. First, I strongly believe that the merge
will go through. Meaning we have to position ourselves in the best way to succeed if the merge goes through, hence, all the investment if people, hence making sure that all of you will have the right position within the new company and some work
that we&#146;re doing from an integration point of view, having in mind that I have been part of many merge. I have never seen such a heavy work in terms of preparation ahead of the merge. Usually you do this type of work, post day zero. There is
plenty of work that we have done before which is going to help us moving forward, and I guess that it&#146;s a great stance to be done. The second is, as I alluded to on different occasions, we are investing in capabilities in different bits and
pieces of the company, which will help the merge, but which would also help the company if were to stay standalone. When we invest, for example, in digital analytics, of course it would help us shift our operating model moving forward. When we
continue to invest in the network, of course it would help us in the mid long run, if we were to stay and to operate on, let&#146;s say, a standalone basis. When I&#146;ve told you, we&#146;re going to reignite a program to extend a little bit our
distribution, moving forward, because that&#146;s a way we will capture new accounts for the company, of course, that will help us as well as if we were to stay standalone. So, we always try to find the right balance investing in things, which makes
sense for the merge and for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-merge,</FONT> because I wish to make sure that we maintain the competitiveness and the potential of growth of our platform. What I have nevertheless always told you, is that it will
not be exactly the same project, meaning that, of course, we&#146;ll not have neither the same assets nor the same skill, nor the same financial resources that if we were to merge. Which means that we have to redefine our operating model, the way we
operate this company in order to make sure that we can continue our journey as a player in this industry. So that is where we are. But for the time being, my expectation from all of you is let&#146;s just stick to the priorities that we have
mentioned. In any case, they are good for whatever will happen, which is great. So we are in the right direction. Any question in the room? I have one question for Jan. Which is does <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> have an
enterprise sales force or more focused on small business? <B><U> </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Jan Geldmacher: </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U></U></B>Yeah, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mo&#146;s</FONT> definitely more focused on small business and they have a very, very good performance
through their retail stores. So they sell a lot. They sell actually a lot more than we do, that&#146;s why we double down on SMB in retail. It&#146;s a big opportunity for us. They&#146;re less developed in the enterprise space. They don&#146;t have
a big IoT game like we do. They don&#146;t have a wire line business, which is a door opener to large enterprises. <B><U> </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>&gt;&gt;Michel

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> stock? Is it the normal stock price Sprint is trading for will turn into however many shares that equals <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> current stock price? I guess the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So the exchange ratio is set at 9.75, so at day zero, whenever that is, Sprint shares will automatically convert. How it trades will hopefully be higher than
where <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> stock is today, because there&#146;s still unknown in terms of timeline and the merger, but as we announced back in April of last year, you know, new
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> has 43&nbsp;billion of synergies, and so as you deliver that, the market will give appreciation for that. Not all at once but over time. That&#146;s why everyone is so excited about the upside
