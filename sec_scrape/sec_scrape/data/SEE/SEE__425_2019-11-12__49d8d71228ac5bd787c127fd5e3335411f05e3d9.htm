<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Hi there. Welcome, everybody! Mike and I are back with some huge news today. This is an important day for us for the proposed New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> for the wireless industry and for consumers across the country, because we are here to announce the first <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> moves we plan to make as the New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes, I said &#145;Moves&#146; plural. Because we&#146;re not just making one announcement today. We&#146;ve
got a lot of news. And more than that, we&#146;re making the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> bigger and bolder after we bring <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and Sprint together to create the New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For nearly seven years, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> has driven every big change in
wireless. But with the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> can and will mean even more, solving even bigger customer pain points. We&#146;ll be able to supercharge our impact
&#150; and do some truly epic stuff. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;ll be candid &#151; this deal to create the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> has taken
longer than we originally thought it would to close. And some people are still asking questions. The right questions. They want to ensure this deal will drive more innovation, stronger competition and lower prices. But those people have yet to
realize that, we want what they want. We are 100&nbsp;percent aligned. We will deliver more innovation, stronger competition and lower prices! </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
preparation, we&#146;ve made incredible progress on the merger. And, as we&#146;ve done that and built the business plan, Mike and I &#150; and the whole leadership team &#150; have been incredibly inspired. I&#146;m not just talking about the
remarkable network we can build or the ways we can change the game for rural America or how we can ignite 5G innovation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;m talking about the ways
we can put this network to work doing good for the country. Good for consumers. Good for competition. Good for innovation. And that&#146;s why we&#146;re calling this set of moves today &#145;5G for Good.&#146; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We want everyone to see what this supercharged <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> can do with this supercharged
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> network. Frankly, we just couldn&#146;t wait any longer to share our plans! </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert,
President&nbsp;&amp; COO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And, it all starts with the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> network that Neville Ray (EVP&nbsp;&amp;
Chief Technology Officer) and team are planning. A network like nothing we&#146;ve seen before. This map is what our 5G network will become, together with Sprint. It&#146;s not just one plus one equals two here. It&#146;s one plus one equals 14.

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the next few years, the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> network will have 14 times
the capacity of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> standalone. Because it just happens to be that the network assets we have, and Sprint has, are so perfectly complementary. And when you put them together, we can do remarkable things.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>*** </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert,
President&nbsp;&amp; COO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Together with Sprint, we&#146;re the only ones who can build 5G with breadth and depth. The way it&#146;s supposed to
be&#151;using all available spectrum bands. When we combine Sprint&#146;s midband with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> lowband and millimeter wave spectrum, we can unlock ridiculous amounts of network capacity. And we can do
it quickly &#150; 14 times more than today, in just the next few years. It&#146;s really simple, this is something we could never do if the merger doesn&#146;t happen. And all that capacity means very good things. I mean, just wrap your head around
this&#151;the combined New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> network will be crazy fast, 450 Mbps fast by 2024. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Let me underscore that.
LTE speeds today are around 25 to 40 Mbps. So this network will be more than ten times faster. Not incrementally faster. Not a marginal speed boost. It&#146;s like your car going from 60 miles an hour to more than 600 miles an hour. It&#146;ll open
up so many new use cases for our connected lives. And not only will it be crazy fast, it&#146;ll be crazy fast for almost everyone. We&#146;ll cover 9 in 10 people in this country with at least 100 Mbps. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Think about that. More than 90&nbsp;percent of Americans with 100 Mbps. That means these speeds won&#146;t just be in major cities. They&#146;ll be in towns
and rural areas all across America. All that capacity means that, as the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> we can create new competition in home broadband as well &#150; one of the most
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">un-competitive</FONT> industries in existence. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And it means rural America will finally have meaningful coverage. Our
business plan is built on covering 90&nbsp;percent of rural Americans with great service and it&#146;s about time. And the best part? The New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> will have so much capacity, and at lower cost to us, that
we&#146;ll be able to deliver our services with lower prices than ever, which you&#146;ll start to see in today&#146;s news. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;ve made concrete
commitments to keep prices steady, or even lower, as we develop 5G. And after that, we&#146;ve built an entire business plan on competing on price with this incredible high capacity, lower-cost network. In fact, all three of today&#146;s
announcements today are made possible by one single thing: Massive Network Capacity. We plan to put it to work to make a real difference. To change wireless with 5G for Good. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Today&#146;s moves are focused on areas where fast, reliable service can change lives for the most deserving and underserved among us. And to start things
off, who is more deserving than the nations&#146; first responders? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our communities face problems today we couldn&#146;t even imagine 10 years ago. Natural disasters in greater and greater frequency. An opioid crisis that seems
out of control. And increasing gun violence in once-safe places. First responders see it all. They fight it all. They help us all. First responders are under more pressure than ever before. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With the 5G network New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> will create, we can do our part to help and say thanks. That&#146;s why today,
I&#146;m proud to announce our Connecting Heroes Initiative &#150; a new <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-year</FONT> commitment to give free 5G service from the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> to our local heroes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;re talking about connecting every public and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</FONT> state and local, police, fire and EMS agency and every
one of their first responders, with unlimited talk, text and smartphone data with the highest network priority. If all agencies sign up, it&#146;s an estimated 7.7&nbsp;billion dollars back in their budgets over 10 years. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Money that can help close the budget shortfall they face year, after year, after year. Money they can put towards extra pay, life-saving tools, and better
support for these heroes, all as a result of the tremendous network capacity we can unleash with the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> after the merger closes. That is what we mean when we talk about using 5G for Good. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">First responders could have chosen to do anything. But they chose to keep us safe. So this is one way we can say &#145;thank you for your service.&#146; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert, President&nbsp;&amp; COO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This is the kind
of difference this new combined company can make in the world. And while our Connecting Heroes initiative launches with New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> next year, today every public and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</FONT> state, county or city law enforcement, fire or EMS organization that&#146;s interested, can get on the list at <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">t-mobile.com/ConnectingHeroes.</FONT> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our team will start working with you on a first come, first served basis, to make sure we&#146;re ready to light things up soon after the creation of the New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> So please go sign up. And that&#146;s just the first multi-billion-dollar investment we&#146;ve got to announce today. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The second part of 5G for Good takes on a massive pain point with an equally massive solution. You know, there are 35&nbsp;million households in this country
with children. And of those, about 15&nbsp;percent have no home internet. So kids in those households can&#146;t do their homework online. Or work on group projects, email teachers, or even keep tabs on their grades. Over time, that lack of access
adds up. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Kids without home internet score significantly lower on math, science and reading tests. It&#146;s called the Homework Gap. And it affects
millions of kids in this country, through no fault of their own, just because they live in a family that can&#146;t afford it or live in a rural community without reliable internet. It&#146;s a huge issue &#150; and only getting more important in
part because there&#146;s no effective competition for home broadband. </P>

<Center><DIV STYLE="width:8.5in" align="left">
 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Almost half &#150; 45&nbsp;percent &#150; of households have no choice, that means one or even zero options
for high-speed home Internet over 100Mbps. And that means affordable home internet is simply out of reach for society&#146;s most vulnerable, and in a time when full participation in the digital economy requires it. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Listen, corporations and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-profits</FONT> and governmental bodies far and wide have tried to chip away at the Homework Gap.
We even have our own effort, as does Sprint &#150; and together we&#146;ve helped over half a million kids get connected. Which is great, but it&#146;s not enough. Our goal should be plain and simple &#150; to connect every single child. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><I>*** </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere, CEO: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Today I&#146;m honored to announce Project 10 Million. A program that will connect 10&nbsp;million households over five years for free. This is a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-billion-dollar</FONT> commitment from the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> That&#146;s the opportunity in front of us, to connect every single child. Equality of opportunity is one of the most
talked about issues in our society today. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And education is supposed to be the great leveler in America. If you work hard, you can get ahead. Yet, these
kids can&#146;t. They fall behind just because they can&#146;t get online to do the assignment. It&#146;s not right. It&#146;s not fair. And it&#146;s not OK. And we&#146;re going to do something about it. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With the scale and incredible network capacity of the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> we can do more than just chip away at this
problem. We can end the homework gap, so that every single child is connected. We plan to use the tremendous capacity of the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> to connect every child. Now, I want you to understand the scale of what
we&#146;re announcing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are only 125&nbsp;million households total in this country and only 35&nbsp;million with kids. We&#146;ll reach nearly one
third of households with kids with Project 10 Million. More than enough to ensure every child is connected. An unprecedented effort at an unprecedented scale. We&#146;re not just chipping away at this problem, we&#146;re pulling out the
frickin&#146; sledgehammer. Because we believe where you live shouldn&#146;t determine where you go in life. And your family&#146;s income shouldn&#146;t determine your outcome. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert, President&nbsp;&amp; COO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Project 10
Million includes completely free service. 100 gigs per year, which is more than enough to cover all the year&#146;s homework and then some. Plus it includes free mobile <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Wi-Fi</FONT> hotspots, and a choice of several
tablets or laptops available at our cost. For 10&nbsp;million households. And once it&#146;s activated, it&#146;s theirs. They keep getting access for five years free of charge. And imagine what else this could mean for those families. They&#146;ll
have access to online training programs and community networks, job postings and government resources that can be life changing. Access to the Internet means access to opportunity. And the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> will
open that door for millions. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I love the impact we can have as the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> the kinds of massive pain points we can solve, the kind of good we
can do. Again, that is what we mean by using 5G for Good. Listen, with this merger, there are still people who have raised questions, as we said earlier. Because they&#146;re looking out for consumers. They want more innovation, stronger
competition, and lower prices. Well, we agree! We want the same things! And we intend to deliver them. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So, we&#146;re going to give you another example
of what we mean by that. Frankly, we&#146;d love to keep this a secret and surprise the hell out of AT&amp;T and Verizon and Comcast and Charter after we launch the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> but people understandably want
to know what increased competition and lower prices really looks like. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So today, we&#146;ll show you. We&#146;re announcing a big step we will make with
the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> to foster competition, drive down prices and totally transform the status quo in wireless. Today, we&#146;re announcing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> Connect &#150; our
lowest prices ever with the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> We&#146;ll slash the price of our lowest cost plan in half. It&#146;s just 15 dollars a month for unlimited talk and text, and two gigabytes of high-speed data.
Fifteen dollars. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">One-five!</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Customers will save at least 180 dollars every year. To a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-income</FONT> family, that can leave room in the budget for school supplies, gas in the tank, car repairs, clothing and more. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert, President&nbsp;&amp; COO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This is going to
help so many families who struggle to make ends meet, so they can get connected and stay connected. And we&#146;re committing that slashed price will stay slashed, for at least five years. Not only that,
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> Connect is the first wireless plan that automatically gets bigger and better every year. Because we&#146;ll introduce something totally new &#150; the Annual Data Upgrade. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We know people use more data every year. So with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> Connect, you pay the same, but you get an additional 500
megabytes of high-speed data per month every year, for at least five years, automatically. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In other words, the plan that launches with two gigs per month
will automatically give you two point five gigs per month the next year. Three gigs per month the following year. After five years, you&#146;ll still pay just 15 dollars a month, but now you&#146;re getting more than twice the high-speed data. And
if you&#146;ve got a 5G phone, you can access 5G, too. It&#146;s included at no extra charge. 15 dollars for 5G. This will be the most affordable plan we&#146;ve ever offered, and it&#146;s designed specifically to help people who are under the most
financial pressure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But of course, anyone and everyone will be able to get it. No special qualifications are required. Listen, a pricing move this
aggressive is going to completely change the wireless game. The other guys will be forced to respond. And that&#146;s going to drive down prices for everyone. It is no wonder AT&amp;T and big cable oppose this merger. This is what more competition
is all about! </P>

the same time, we&#146;re prepared for litigation on December&nbsp;9 with the states who have taken action to block the deal. It&#146;s also important to note that we do have FCC and DOJ approval, two federal agencies that are in charge of reviewing
these. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And in that process, by the way, we made some wonderful commitments that are great for people to review; commitments associated with how much we
will spend building out our 5G network, how much of the country we will cover with 5G, how much of rural America we will cover, how much <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband marketing we will do and what period of time, how
we&#146;re going to position DISH as a competitor with the Sprint prepaid brands and the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-band</FONT> spectrum and the transition services and MVNO. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And then we started to &#150; by the way, I should point out that the action taken by the states was unprecedented in one way. They took it before the federal
agencies had ruled, but that&#146;s their right. We&#146;ve been meeting with many, many states, including New York, where we are today, and hearing what&#146;s important for them. We happen to have had a number of states pull out of the suit. And
what&#146;s important to these states is exactly the things that we&#146;re talking about, very important, they want to know what&#146;s going to happen to jobs, what&#146;s going to happen to prices, what&#146;s going to happen to competition, what
are you going to build in my state, what&#146;s going to happen to low income. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So indirectly, I would say, these answers are all part of the things that
are critical to them. And I will tell you that I did send a letter this morning to various Attorneys General, including Attorney General James in New York, saying, hey, here&#146;s some other things that are going on that might be pertinent. And I
really do hope as a byproduct of this that Americans, consumers will start thinking about what is it that&#146;s coming with New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> what is it that&#146;s going to happen, think about these first
responders, think about what&#146;s happening with the education gap, and look at all these things and look at the commitments that we have made. And I think together, either through a settlement or through a very successful trial, the New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is coming, and this is a good statement as to what we&#146;re going to be about. Thank you for the question. Operator? </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Thank you. We&#146;ll take our next question from Eli Blumenthal of CNET. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Eli Blumenthal &#150; CNET: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Good morning, everybody. So,
obviously, a lot of what you talked about today is contingent on the Sprint merger. Will we see any of the initiatives, for the first responders, low income, et cetera, happen if this merger doesn&#146;t go through? Is this an all or nothing type
of, I guess, announcement? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere, CEO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yeah.
Let&#146;s &#150; Mike, do you want to start? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert, President&nbsp;&amp; COO: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;d say, absolutely, everything we announced today is dependent on the massive capacity expansion that comes from the New
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> Everything we announced today, though, is also consistent with the values of our company, the values of the company we have today. As examples as we mentioned a little earlier in the broadcast, we
have initiatives in these areas at smaller scales. In fact, we announced a couple of weeks ago a stand-alone <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> initiative for first responders we&#146;re very proud of with <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">half-off</FONT> pricing. We have initiatives in the education space called EmpowerED. But they&#146;re nothing compared to what we can do at a greater scale once we have the synergies and the combined network capacity of
this new company, and that&#146;s really what we were announcing today, our values, our supercharged <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> ideals taken to the next level by the capabilities of this merger. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere, CEO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Right. Eli, this isn&#146;t &#150; we
don&#146;t want this to sound like a threat. What&#146;s happening, and we&#146;ve said it a few times, we&#146;ve said it in the video, is putting this company and these networks together, 1 plus 1 equals 14. It truly does. There&#146;s
$60&nbsp;billion that we&#146;ll be investing in our network and 5G capabilities. We will have 14 times the capacity of the current stand-alone <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> Now, what we&#146;re also demonstrating is with that
capacity, we&#146;re going to do things for good and we&#146;re going to do things for competition and we&#146;re going to supercharge the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier.</FONT> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So it&#146;s not that we&#146;re saying we won&#146;t. We couldn&#146;t, nobody could. But there&#146;s magic in putting these two networks together, and
that&#146;s why this is critically important. And I wanted to make sure everybody could see right when it comes together what we&#146;re going to do, and I think you have to admit these three programs together tell you quite a bit about who the New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is going to be and how the game is going to play. </P>

doing? Obviously, proof is in the pudding with details on some of this. So can you give us some indication of how someone, particularly on the homework gap plan, would qualify? It&#146;s for low income people I gather. What&#146;s sort of the
threshold there? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert, President&nbsp;&amp; COO: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yeah, absolutely. Matt, do you want to kick it off? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John
Legere, CEO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But I did want to start by clarifying, because there was a question, Ed, that USA TODAY reporters are not seen as first responders. I
just wanted to make that clear. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Matt Staneff, Executive Vice President&nbsp;&amp; CMO: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Hi, Ed. Thanks for the question. Let me first start and talk a little bit about this homework gap initiative. There&#146;s 35&nbsp;million households in the US
with kids in school. This is <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">K-12.</FONT> 15% of those don&#146;t have access to the Internet right now. That&#146;s the first piece of this program. This is really about bridging this homework gap and going after
families that can&#146;t afford the access they need to get online. 7 out of 10 teachers assign homework online. The kids get left behind if they don&#146;t have access to this. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So what we&#146;re going to do with this program &#150; and again, other companies are making efforts in this area and what&#146;s great about what we can do
with New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is we&#146;re fully funded and we&#146;re fully able to solve this for all of them. We&#146;ve got 10&nbsp;million &#150; that&#146;s why it&#146;s called the Project 10 Million &#150; is
over the next five years, we&#146;re going to solve this problem for everybody. We&#146;re looking at the intersection of families without Internet at home that have income issues with being able to access that and allowing them free opportunity for
service for this. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">What we want to do is we also want to do it right. So we&#146;re going to go reach out to the local communities, the states, and design
the criteria to get enrollment to this program. So, it&#146;s easy and seamless, and this is the way we do everything at <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> So, we haven&#146;t solved everything yet, partly because we want to make sure
we do it right and we can really take this problem on, and completely in the homework gap with this initiative. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And, Matt, a couple of things we have decided. First of all, the 10&nbsp;million units will be allocated to each state on a population basis, so percent of
total national population. So that&#146;s the starting point for each state, out of the 10&nbsp;million units. And then, as you were saying, we&#146;re going to allocate them based on some simple principles. They&#146;re for families with children
and that are school aged, that there are families that don&#146;t meet a certain income threshold, and you under-connected. And so those are the principles and we&#146;re going to work with local organizations to figure out the best way to allocate
it based on those principles. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere, CEO: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yeah. It&#146;s I should say, obviously, we have spent so much time in the last 18 months talking with various legislators and states about this deal. And this
is an example of one where, when we&#146;ve spoken to several Attorneys General about this idea, when people think there&#146;s a got you, they&#146; say, okay, well, how are you going to do that? Our real answer is, you tell us. What we want to do
is we want to work with you for you to tell us where are &#150; we know who needs it. You show us where they are and we&#146;ll jointly figure out a way to get this in their hand. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But this truly is exactly what it sounds like. This is an attempt to take the significant capacity and power of the New
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> network and solve the homework gap. And for me, it gives me chills, because we really can do it. And so together we&#146;re going to find out exactly how to do it, but the end result is going to be
children who will be connected and able to do their assignments and succeed that they couldn&#146;t before. And for me, that&#146;s one of the most exciting things I&#146;ve ever been a part of. </P>

</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Thanks for having the call, guys, and the presentation. Your merger agreement expired, I think, at Friday night. Is there any consideration by <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> to renegotiate the deal or seek a lower price for Sprint? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere, CEO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yeah. Thanks, David, for the question.
Yeah, there&#146;s been a lot of misunderstanding about that. Just clarify a few points on that. So the business combination arrangement, the BCA, had in it something called the longstop date, and it was a point which was 18 months in November 1.
And it didn&#146;t stop the partnership or the moving forward of the business combination arrangement. What it did is that was the date after which either party had a unilateral right to walk away from the deal. </P>
 <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">9 </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Now, it&#146;s sort of like going month to month on your rent. There&#146;s no more lease. You continue to
move forward as we do with great partners. But if you&#146;re going to extend it to another date, you need to take action and amend the BCA. So what I can say is, yes, we are having discussions as partners about whether and how long we move forward
the date. And I would say that in a period in which we are full together moving forward to get this deal approved, and what if any items should be agreed between the parties in exchange for agreeing to extend those terms. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So, yes, we are having conversations and discussions. But be clear, the business combination arrangement, everything is moving forward 100% and we&#146;re
discussing how to set a new longstop date and what those terms would be. So, I hope that&#146;s helpful. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>David Shepardson &#150; Thomson Reuters:

the actual terms. But the question is, okay, so November&nbsp;1 came and went, and if we need a certain amount of time to lock each other into a date, what are the things that are important to each of us. And they can be value, they can be how do
you handle things that have happened that need to possibly be indemnified, how do you agree on future things that you will share in order to settle the deal, et cetera. So, it&#146;s a broad array of things, very partnership-oriented. And as soon as
we have light of day on that, I&#146;m sure we&#146;ll put that out. And it shouldn&#146;t be too far out in the future, but it&#146;s a positive conversation and it could include any of the things that you&#146;re talking about. </P>

Just briefly, you guys have made a lot of commitments. Obviously, the homework gap, much lower prices for first responders, and so on. What do you think &#150; is there anything you could do to satisfy the AGs at this point? Would it be a longer
commitment in terms of the years before you could be allowed to raise prices? I mean, is there something specific the AGs want that you think you could give them to head off this legal challenge? </P>

that &#150; we have made a tremendous amount of commitment. And I think it&#146;s important now, not just for people in the governmental process, but for Americans to sit down and say, okay, what&#146;s this all about, what does it mean. And if my
state proceeds with this and they quote win, what do they get? And if we settle or if we lose, what happens? Well, listen, $60&nbsp;billion to build the 5G network that no country on earth has will not happen. We&#146;ve committed by year to the
penetration points on 5G, rural coverage, competition in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband, pricing protections, along with these new items, we&#146;ve done great, great lengths to position DISH as a very formidable

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So if you compare all those things too &#150; Sprint, who is struggling, I think that&#146;s not being
disrespectful to our partner, but very clearly, DISH has a head start and a set of commitments that will make them a much more formidable competitor than Sprint is or can be in the short-term and a New

Connect be available as an option for anybody or just low income families? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Jon Freier, Executive Vice President, Consumer Markets: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yeah, you bet. So, Tiffany, the short answer is, it&#146;s available for anyone. It&#146;s not just for low income families, but it&#146;s available for
anyone. And like Mike said just a few moments ago, when you contrast this launch next to what Verizon did, so Verizon earlier this year announced some portions of some areas of two cities for 5G, and there was a $10 price increase with that. What
we&#146;re announcing today is 5G nationwide in stand-alone <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> and of course, a deeper, broader, high capacity network with the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> for just $15 a month;
and that&#146;s 50% off from our lowest price plan that we have today. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So, for families that are struggling to figure out how to &#150; hey, do I have
access to the Internet, or do I have food on the table? Do I have clothes for my children? Do I have school supplies for my children? Or do I have access for the Internet? The New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is not going to put
families in that position of having to make those tradeoffs. The answer is yes. And so for $15 a month. And then, of course, with the annual data upgrade, another 500 megabytes per year in terms of increase in that plan, but it&#146;s available for
not only folks with economic disadvantages, but it&#146;s available for anyone and everyone in this country. </P>

checked that box. And you know, when <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> does this, you know people are going to follow. That&#146;s how it happens. That&#146;s what we do as the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier.</FONT> So

Thanks for taking the question. I also asked this on Twitter, but I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the Connecting Heroes program. Obviously, AT&amp;T is kind of really involved in the space in terms of FirstNet. So, are you
positioning this as a sort of FirstNet competitor or is this more of just kind of an individual benefit for first responders? And if it is the FirstNet competitor, can you talk about how you&#146;re going to ensure reliability on the 5G network?
Thank you. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere, CEO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Okay. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert, President&nbsp;&amp; COO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I can start. No,
it&#146;s not a FirstNet competitor. It&#146;s an AT&amp;T competitor. We applaud FirstNet and the initiative behind it. But the bottom line is AT&amp;T won that bid and they&#146;re planning to monetize our first responder community by overcharging
them. And our view is the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> brings competition to everybody, and that means bringing competition in this space to AT&amp;T. And our thought is with the values of our company, somebody has to address
this budget gap that first responders have. We can because of the massive capacity of this new company, so we will. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Katz, Executive
Vice-President, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> for Business: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yeah. And the fact is over 75% of first responder agencies report that
they have a budget shortfall and oftentimes, way too often, we hear that that causes a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">trade-off</FONT> on critical lifesaving equipment or wireless. And many, many agencies we talk to, unfortunately, have to make
that <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">trade-off,</FONT> not provide wireless to people in our community that can least afford not to have it. These are the heroes in our community that are oftentimes first on the scene when there&#146;s a disaster.
And too many of these agencies don&#146;t have wireless, and that&#146;s exactly what this initiative is going after. If all agencies take it up, it allows us to put over $7&nbsp;billion back into the budgets of agencies that they can spend on other
lifesaving equipment. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And for all of us, this is the most important connection in our lives, right, our own connection&#146;s important. But when lives are on the line, the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But there is a message here, let&#146;s remind ourselves what the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> is, what the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> does. We solve pain points. We cause disruption. We try to get others to do what we do, so 100% we urge AT&amp;T to give free service to first responders. We urge Verizon to give free service to first
responders. I&#146;m not sure that was the FirstNet business plan. I will point out that the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> if you&#146;re thinking about this financially, the $43&nbsp;billion with the synergies that are going
to help fund the build of this network and create this gigantic capacity and the economics that we&#146;ve outlined to the market, they are fully intact. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So, AT&amp;T, I agree, first responders should be treated as heroes. So we&#146;re not trying to copy you. We&#146;re trying to give you a better example of
what to do with your new found capabilities with a section of customers that really need your help. And if not, they know where they can come and we are going to love having them here. Okay. Did you... </P>

you just address the reliability question then, since 5G is kind of a new technology? I mean, I think reliability, especially for first responders, is a huge question. </P>

back to the same issue. This new company with its $43&nbsp;billion in synergies is going to allow an unprecedented investment in our network. Neville talked about some of those initiatives. Neville&#146;s actions are backed by a $60&nbsp;billion
budget over the next few years, that&#146;s incredible. So, we&#146;ll be spending it on capacity, but of course, we&#146;ll be spending it on those kinds of initiatives as well, because these connections are so important. </P>

<Center><DIV STYLE="width:8.5in" align="left">
 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So, hardening the network, making it increasingly reliable over the years, those continue to be priorities
for ours. We&#146;ve done a nice job in that area, but there&#146;s so much more we can do. This new company has the financial resources to get it done. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere, CEO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yeah, let&#146;s keep in mind &#150; I
know that&#146;s not what this call is totally about, but with the work that Neville has done already in what others are calling 5GE, or advanced 4G LTE, we cover the same blanket footprint of the other players. We cover the entire country, right?
We have a satisfaction rate on our network that is very high. Now, when you move forward with the $60&nbsp;billion of network investment in the creation of the 5G, the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is the only company, by the
way, anywhere on earth that has a coherent, full strategy to build a ubiquitous <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-,</FONT> and high-band 5G network, right? </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So we&#146;ve got the synergies and the capital, the commitments that we&#146;ve made to the FCC to make this a blanket set of capabilities. And AT&amp;T and
Verizon absolutely do not have a full 5G strategy. I don&#146;t think they ever plan to, but now they&#146;re going to be forced to. So I think that&#146;s a secondary piece of this. So I will put our current network and our 5G plan as the most
important reason why first responders should be with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert, President&nbsp;&amp; COO:

of volunteer organizations that currently don&#146;t have funds to support phones. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Katz, Executive Vice-President,

designed for. And, unfortunately, like I said before, too many agencies find themselves in that position, and that&#146;s exactly what this initiative is looking to address. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere, CEO: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yeah. We want to make sure we stick
with it, because that is &#150; I love these questions because you have some groups who clearly are the first responders that are saving people every day, and yes, even if you didn&#146;t have a budget for it, this is for you. If you&#146;re a first
responder organization who has a very small budget, you can save that portion of your budget by getting this capability. And we will be so proud for you to reallocate that to other lifesaving requirements within your organization. And it&#146;s
most, most important in what you&#146;re talking about, a small, local organization that needs help. So, again, we&#146;re very proud of this. This is going to be one of those things that the more you peel it back, the better it&#146;s going to
sound, because it&#146;s real and it&#146;s a big commitment. It&#146;s something we&#146;re very proud of. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Okay, operator. </P>

we&#146;re getting a lot of the same kinds of questions online as well about availability. All these things are things we&#146;re targeting to come out with as soon as we possibly can after the close of the merger. Our teams are working hard on them
right now, as we&#146;ve talked to you about. But this is one that we can hit with right away. We know how to do this. This is something that we can come right out of the gates and tackle. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And as John said earlier, we wanted to keep this a surprise. We&#146;ve been planning to do this. We&#146;ve been talking about bringing a level of
competition, especially for people who have affordability challenges in this sector. We wanted to bring a level of competition to AT&amp;T and Verizon they&#146;ve never seen, and we wanted to surprise them. But circumstances just made it right that
it&#146;s time for us to start talking about what we plan to do anyway. So we&#146;ll hit right out of the gates with that one. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>John Legere, CEO:

announcement, it&#146;s not. We are this close to the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> If we go to trial in December&nbsp;9, we&#146;re going to win. The new company is here and we&#146;re just anxious to put it out there. Now,
on the other hand, the reason I&#146;ve been open to having the conversation with you about potentially settling is because the things that the states want are the exact same things that we want. And if we can violently agree and get things done,
I&#146;m wide open to it, whatever anybody needs to do to feel like they won, I just want to get this New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> off and start helping this country in ways that I think will be amazing. Okay. Operator? </P>

managed to cut deals with the states as part of the coalition suing to block the merger. Wondering if you expect to cut any more of those deals. And what it is exactly that you&#146;re offering and does it vary by state? Obviously, with Mississippi,
that deal looked very similar to the commitment that has already been made on the national level, so wondering what the difference was and what the calculations are going forward as you talk to other states and potentially cut other deals. </P>

have come to a lot of deals, a lot of agreements, few small ones, the FCC and the Department of Justice, 18 of 19 state PUC&#146;s. By the way, we have 19 states governors, Attorneys General, et cetera, who support the transaction, and now we are
discussing with the litigant parties, those that are involved. And frankly, we&#146;re not disclosing settlement items here, but they&#146;re exactly the things that you would expect, which is, hey, in my state what&#146;s going to happen.
What&#146;s going to happen to competition? Will you build out in my state? Will we really get 5G? Will rural coverage go up? Will there be <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-home</FONT> broadband? What&#146;s going to happen to jobs? What&#146;s
going to happen to pricing? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And in general we are able to turn around and reach for the commitments that we&#146;ve made to the federal agencies. And
then look at them and say, okay, well, let&#146;s talk about a few things, in your state here&#146;s the things that are going to happen because of this, and by the way, we&#146;re willing to let you have enforcement capability over that, because
we&#146;re not fooling around. This is what we&#146;re going to do. We&#146;ll agree. We&#146;ll commit. This is what&#146;s going to happen to your state. And then we step back, and we move on. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">But in general when you so violently agree, it&#146;s easy. Now, each state has slightly different questions, and the hardest one over time is for them to
feel comfortable that there&#146;s sufficient competition, right; and that comes in many forms. That comes in understanding what DISH is going to do, understanding the situation Sprint is going to be in, understanding what the New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is all about, and that&#146;s a lot of the things that we&#146;re talking about here today. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I will tell you
that we&#146;re in New York. New York is a great example. The things that the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> are going to do in this state for the citizens of New York, we&#146;ve already announced a major new Customer
Experience Center outside of Rochester in New York. We&#146;re looking at a potential additional site in Long Island. These are big job creating sites. We&#146;ve made commitments to the state about job protections, we&#146;ve made commitments here

available to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> MVNOs? It&#146;s really not about sets of towers. It&#146;s about taking all those assets and creating one combined network using the assets of both companies, and that&#146;s what allows
it to unlock all that capacity. It&#146;s not taking one plus one and making both available. It&#146;s taking the resources of the two and creating something truly great, because of how the resources of the company just happen to be so
complementary. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So it happened &#150; the benefits start to roll in right away. It&#146;s about a three-year process before the kinds of numbers

together to extend the longstop date to a certain time that will give us enough period of time to get this deal done. And, obviously, there&#146;s many ways to do that and it could be any of the ones that you&#146;re talking about. </P>

we&#146;ll announce or not, because remember, nothing happens, right? The process goes forward. You just have two parties who have a unilateral right to walk. I don&#146;t see either party wanting to do that. But there&#146;s good certainty for a
number of reasons in any publicly traded company of having a clear extension of that period. So we got a number of items that we are talking about and I&#146;ll be glad to share that as soon as it&#146;s finalized. </P>

indulge me for one more. I wanted to ask you about the discussions that you might have had with the states. Could you talk a little bit about the efforts that you have made towards like getting them to the table to talk about a settlement? </P>

few. And I would say that almost across the board the Attorneys General themselves have been very open and we&#146;ve had very frank discussions. They&#146;ve been very clear about their concerns and we&#146;ve had many <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-up</FONT> conversations. And we &#150; as I&#146;m disclosing, I don&#146;t think it&#146;s a secret, we have made settlement proposals as ways to continue those conversations. There&#146;s not a one of the
Attorneys General, including the two major ones in New York and California, who have said other than we&#146;re interested and open to continuing have discussions. They have a job to do. They need to understand the potentials associated with
competition, the impacts on the marketplace. But I think what you can see, the portfolio of what we&#146;ve done is clearly, I believe, heavily answering any questions that you would have, especially as it relates to the benefits in the interest of
consumers in each of the states. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A trial is set for December 9. I just continue to say, we are extremely confident in our case. And so, it&#146;s a
matter of one way or the other this New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> is coming forward. But the conversations with the Attorneys General have not been hostile. They have a job to do and we tend to vehemently agree on the
questions. And then, it&#146;s just a matter of giving them the things that are required for them to feel that those questions have been answered. Okay, operator. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;ve a couple questions. One is, you talked about in the first responder plan, they&#146;ll be given the highest priority. Of course, AT&amp;T has
priority access and preemption as part of their offering for FirstNet, and Verizon does as well. Are you committing to that? And is there any limit at all in the data that first responder could use that would be capped in anyway or it would all be
free? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Katz, Executive Vice-President, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> for Business: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yeah. Thanks, Paul. Those are great questions. So WPS is available today and it will continue to be available on the new plan. And on data for these plans for
our first responders, there is no cap. There is no throttling there is, there is no <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">de-prioritization.</FONT> They will have the highest priority on our network, because I think we can all agree that if anybody needs
to stay connected, it&#146;s this group of first responders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Paul Kirby &#150; TR Daily: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So WPS is for voice, so I&#146;m asking about data. Verizon and AT&amp;T offer preemption and priority access to public safety for data. So you&#146;re
offering that as part of your offering to first responders? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Katz, Executive Vice-President, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> for
Business: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So data will have the highest priority on our network with no throttling and no limits. Preemption is available across all three carriers.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Paul Kirby &#150; TR Daily: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So you are offering

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">And then the other question I have is, you both talked about 14 times capacity. I think when you first announced the merger, you said 8 times. And you talked
about $60&nbsp;billion in spending on 5G. When you first announced the merger you said $40&nbsp;billion. So why the change? </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Oh, thank you for the potential got you questions. Yeah, those were all logical questions. The $40&nbsp;billion was an overall cap ex spend for three years,
$60&nbsp;billion is a network spend over six years. So they&#146;re both numbers that we have committed to. Right now we&#146;re speaking more pertinently about the spend on the 5G network capability and network, which is $60&nbsp;billion. And the 8
times, 14 times, it&#146;s relative to the capacity versus whether it&#146;s the stand-alone <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> or the two stand-alone companies, et cetera. So I can give it to you every which way what it is, is
it&#146;s a ****load more capacity than any version you want to have. But if you&#146;d like follow up on those, since I&#146;ve had to testify in the Senate and Congress and use both of those, I can guarantee you that they all make sense. But
that&#146;s generally what they are. Does that make sense? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*** </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Walt Piecyk &#150; LightShed Partners: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Just a question
on the $15 plan and just to get a sense of kind of the impact to your existing base, you&#146;ve got Boost customers that potentially are low usage. What&#146;s the mix of your overall base prepaid and postpaid that you think currently use 2 GB or
less, and 5 GB and less I guess. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Mike Sievert, President&nbsp;&amp; COO: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yeah, Walt, I&#146;m not going to unpack it for you in detail, but I can tell you couple things. One is, this is going to be a plan that everybody qualifies
for. We&#146;re going to be launching it on the flagship <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> brand, anybody can qualify for it. There are no conditions or restrictions. It&#146;s not an income qualified plan or anything like that. So
that&#146;s how we do it at the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier.</FONT> And by the way, although we haven&#146;t talked about it a lot, there are two plans that we&#146;re launching. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2 GB plan for $15, which is half off, as we&#146;ve been saying, our previous lowest price for a plan with talk, text, and data at 2 GB or any gigs, as
well as a $25 plan with 5 GB, which to your point, is a very mainstream usage scenario that again is still lower than our previous lowest price. So mainstream 5 GB at a lower price, $25, than we&#146;ve ever offered talk, text, and data for.
It&#146;s pretty amazing. And then with the annual data upgrade, both of those move each year. So in the second year, there&#146;s a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">0.5-GB</FONT> more per month on each of those two plans. So taken together,
that&#146;s the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> Connect initiative and it&#146;s a mainstream offering. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Now I will say, and I want to be
really clear about this, that these plans are factored into the business models that we&#146;ve presented to you. And so when we talked about the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> last year and the long-term aspirations for cash
flow generation, for revenues, for EBITDA, for the margins of the business, these kinds of initiatives were contemplated. What we&#146;re doing today is we&#146;re <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-disclosing</FONT> them. So there&#146;s no
change to our synergies nor to our long-term aspirations and financial outlooks that we&#146;ve previously talked about. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Walt Piecyk &#150; LightShed
Partners: </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Got it. So in Roger&#146;s article, where you talked about this like $7&nbsp;billion cost on &#150; or I guess you didn&#146;t phrase it as
a cost, but you said benefit to public safety. And again, the rate plans you just outlined compare like $35 for 3 GB at Boost, obviously, less than what the cable operators are even charging. So is the theory here that in terms of why it
doesn&#146;t impact your previously stated guidance and outlook is that you&#146;re just going to get so many customers from cable and other guys based on these rate plans relative to potentially a rerate, so there&#146;s no difference in revenue or
EBITDA, is that the kind of logic behind this? </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Well, a couple things. First of all, yes, there is some logic like that. Obviously, we&#146;re doing these things to demonstrate what the network is capable
of, 5G for good, to reinforce our values. But when we do that, we&#146;ve learned that our brand grows and people become more attracted to our brand. We&#146;ve had plenty of experience now across seven years of what it&#146;s like to do initiatives
that are good, and that also draw attention to our brand. And as we&#146;ve grown more confident in that, we&#146;ve been able to forecast the effects of that. So we think this is going to be very powerful. Customers in general are going to be
attracted to a company that&#146;s values driven like this and there&#146;s a factor in there. But separately within these communities, this is just a chance for us to go do something really powerful and we have the capacity, and so why
shouldn&#146;t we allocate some of it to something this significant? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>*** </B></P>

I&#146;m going to do one on the phone, and then we&#146;re going to have wrap up. But Ed Oswald has a question that I think we can answer quickly unless we let Neville answer it, then we&#146;ll be here till Tuesday. While we&#146;re talking about
capacity a lot here with the merger, can Neville provide some kind of timeline as to the goals on speed as we move through 2020 and beyond with 5G. What speeds can consumers expect in the near-, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-</FONT> and
long-term? Neville? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Neville Ray, Executive Vice President&nbsp;&amp; CTO: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yeah. So super quick. So we&#146;ve talked about with the 5G foundational layer we&#146;re rolling out this year, so folks will start to see speeds on LTE
double in most areas. Peaks will be certainly improved to moving north of &#150; into the 100 Mbps range especially in the early rollouts. If you look at the kind of five-year program of network build, obviously we&#146;re looking to bring as much
benefit as we can early in the program, completing our 600 rollout, and then as fast as we can rolling out the 2.5 GHz spectrum for 5G across a large and material site base. So that&#146;s very front ended in the plan and that will certainly drive
an early rise in speeds. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The speeds that John and Mike talked about will be perfected over the time of the program, but we&#146;ll see hundreds of
megabit averages in the early running. And to give you a quick flavor of how ready we are, we literally have thousands of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> sites ready today, as soon as we have the approval, whereby we can start
deploying 2.5 GHz spectrum for 5G and start building out this layer cake, on top of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-band</FONT> that we&#146;ve already laid down in those areas. So we&#146;re ready to run, we&#146;re waiting for the okay,
and as soon as we have it, we will be laying down a lot more spectrum and speeds will markedly improve even in the first 12 months of this program. </P>

have faith that John and Mike and Neville are devoted to this strategy and to the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> plans that you guys have followed. But companies are not men and new leadership can adopt new strategies. What
guarantees are you putting down that either you guys will stay to see the length of this strategy through or that the company is committing to this strategy in the long term in a way that, for instance a new CEO could not make a <FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Great question, Sascha. Thank you for that. And I&#146;m sure of couple things. One is, you know our company and you know our culture, and you know that the
company and the culture is not about me or Mike or Neville, and that&#146;s why we&#146;re happy to show you not only these men, but this woman leader of our organization. The New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> culture and
plans are deep and committed to and are part of who we are, and to do anything other than that would be a disgrace. And I have certainly no &#150; Mike&#146;s about 20 years younger than me, so I think you can probably lock him in through the whole
5G analysis. But I would say, Mike and I and Neville and Braxton and this full team are very committed to this, as is our board; and you have that from us as individuals and in the culture of the company that we&#146;ve created. </P>

strategy any team would pursue with this set of assets. The bottom line is, when you put these two companies together and you have capacity like this, it&#146;s very obvious what you do with it. We&#146;ve got this massive stadium and it&#146;s
mostly empty. You fill it up. Any management team would fill that stadium up, bring more competition to AT&amp;T and Verizon, lower prices, take their customers, and generate revenues that way. That&#146;s the business plan that we&#146;ve put out
last April. And it wasn&#146;t just because we were behind it. It was because that&#146;s what any team would do to maximize their business performance with these set of assets. </P>
