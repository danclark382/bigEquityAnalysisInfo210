<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Bellevue, Washington and Overland Park, Kansas</B> &#150; November&nbsp;14, 2019 &#150; <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> US (NASDAQ: TMUS)
and Sprint Corporation (NYSE: S) today announced that, following the completion of their proposed merger to create the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> the company will locate its fourth of five planned Customer Experience
Centers (CEC) in New York&#146;s Nassau County. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">state-of-the-art</FONT></FONT></FONT> customer support facility will create up to 1,000 direct
local jobs with great wages and benefits and provide personalized support to customers through <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> innovative Team of Experts (TEX) service model. Buildout of the site is also expected to create
additional indirect jobs in areas such as construction.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> has committed to using union tradespeople for
construction of the two announced New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> CECs that will be located in New York, pending the merger&#146;s close. The company has pledged to work with the Building and Construction Trades Council of
Nassau&nbsp;&amp; Suffolk Counties to ensure a Project Labor Agreement is in place for the CECs, including the Nassau County site. Additionally, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> has also committed that no tax incentives from
government or economic development entities will be used to operate this facility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Nassau County joins three previously-announced New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> CEC locations: Overland Park, Kansas, Rochester, New York, and Kingsburg, California. Each will bring <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">top-notch</FONT> customer care to New
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> customers through <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> award-winning Team of Experts (TEX) approach. With TEX, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> delivers personalized
support to all of the company&#146;s customers nationwide through dedicated teams that are committed to ensuring the success of every customer relationship. Customers have direct access to specialists focused on addressing their issues when they
call or message for assistance. The specialists can also work with local retail and engineering teams to address a wide variety of topics and tackle complex challenges. TEX teams typically serve customers primarily based in their broader geographic
area. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The development of the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">state-of-the-art</FONT></FONT></FONT> CECs is core to the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> plan to put customers first and
bring jobs to communities. These investments, together with plans to expand two existing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> Customer Experience Centers, will create up to 5,600 additional American jobs by 2021. The combined companies
will have 7,500 more customer care professionals in 2024 than the stand-alone companies would have employed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;We love the Empire State and Nassau
County is a great spot for our next New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> Customer Experience Center! <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> commitment to truly taking care of customers will only get supercharged with
the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and our Team of Experts approach is all about making personal connections. That starts with great people &#151; and some of the best are in Long Island! Once this merger closes, we know Long
Islanders will bring an incredible work ethic, a commitment to innovation, and amazing energy to taking care of our customers and we can&#146;t wait to welcome them to the team!&#148; said <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> CEO John

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;The New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> investment in Nassau County
exemplifies the type of corporate economic activity we hope to attract. The CEC project will provide a meaningful economic boost for our community &#150; creating up to 1,000 new and exciting job opportunities, while generating significant tax
revenue and increasing innovation. I look forward to working alongside our outstanding partners helping our residents build career skills, find employment and succeed in our community to help fill these up to 1,000
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> positions. We are pleased to collaborate with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and look forward to working with the company to bring the benefits of the New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> to Nassau County&#146;s 1.3&nbsp;million residents,&#148; said Laura Curran, Nassau County Executive. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> strategy to build their latest Customer Experience Center in Nassau County using Union Labor is a signal that they value the importance of what a strong middle class means to the region. Nassau
County&#146;s success largely depends on companies like <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> with bold business plans. They will be an integral part of the solution to effectively transform the region at a time when the population is
growing. The Building and Construction Trades Council is eager to provide our &#145;Value on Display, Everyday,&#146;&#148; said Matthew Aracich, President of The Building and Construction Trades Council of Nassau and Suffolk
Counties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> Nassau County customer care employees will join a
company that has consistently been featured on national, regional and state &#147;Best Place to Work&#148; lists year after year&#151;nearly 60 national and local workplace awards in 2019, including recognition as a great employer for parents,
diversity, women, Hispanics, LGBTQ and more. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> care centers were recognized on best place to work lists 22 times in 2018 alone! In addition to great pay, the New
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> Care team members will be eligible to receive <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> outstanding benefits, including health coverage, stock grants, college tuition assistance,
a childcare subsidy benefit, paid parental leave and adoption/surrogacy benefits. They will also have opportunities for career development and management preparation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The new Customer Experience Centers are just one way the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> will invest billions of dollars in job creation
and infrastructure in the United States. Sprint and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> together will employ more people in the U.S. than both companies would separately. Other investments include building out an industry-leading
nationwide 5G network, delivering more competition and new choice to customers like broadband, and opening new stores to an expanding customer base. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
completion of the combination remains subject to regulatory approvals and certain other customary closing conditions. Additional information can be found at: www.NewTMobile.com. </P>
