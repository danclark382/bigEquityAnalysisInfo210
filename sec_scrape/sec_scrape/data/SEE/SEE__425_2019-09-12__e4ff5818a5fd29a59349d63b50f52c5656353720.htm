released the following statement in support of the proposed <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> US, Inc. and Sprint Corporation merger. Rutledge joined the U.S. Department of Justice in formally supporting the merger based on conditions

merger will result in increased quality and more competitive prices for Arkansans by expanding rural broadband access and expediting 5G technology to provide an essential service for a desperately underserved population.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The proposed merger agreement protects Arkansas consumers from any potentially anti-competitive market effects. As part of the merger agreement, <FONT
