<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bellevue, Washington and Overland Park, Kansas&#150; November&nbsp;14, 2019 &#150; <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> US (NASDAQ: TMUS) and
Sprint Corporation (NYSE: S) today announced that, following the completion of their proposed merger to create the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> the company will locate its fourth of five planned Customer Experience Centers
(CEC) in New York&#146;s Nassau County. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">state-of-the-art</FONT></FONT></FONT> customer support facility will create up to 1,000 direct local jobs
with great wages and benefits and provide personalized support to customers through <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> innovative Team of Experts (TEX) service model. Buildout of the site is also expected to create additional
indirect jobs in areas such as construction. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&nbsp;T-Mobile</FONT> has committed to using union tradespeople for construction of the two announced New TMobile CECs that will be located in New York, pending the
merger&#146;s close. The company has pledged to work with the Building and Construction Trades Council of Nassau&nbsp;&amp; Suffolk Counties to ensure a Project Labor Agreement is in place for the CECs, including the Nassau County site.
Additionally, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> has also committed that no tax incentives from government or economic development entities will be used to operate this facility. &nbsp;Nassau County joins three previously-announced New
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> CEC locations: Overland Park, Kansas, Rochester, New York, and Kingsburg, California. Each will bring <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">top-notch</FONT> customer care to New TMobile customers through <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> award-winning Team of Experts (TEX) approach. With TEX, TMobile delivers personalized support to all of the company&#146;s customers nationwide through dedicated teams that are committed to ensuring
the success of every customer relationship. Customers have direct access to specialists focused on addressing their issues when they call or message for assistance. The specialists can also work with local retail and engineering teams to address a
wide variety of topics and tackle complex challenges. TEX teams typically serve customers primarily based in their broader geographic area. &nbsp;The development of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">state-of-the-art</FONT></FONT></FONT> CECs is core to the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> plan to put customers first and bring jobs to communities. These investments, together with plans to
expand two existing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> Customer Experience Centers, will create up to 5,600 additional American jobs by 2021. The combined companies will have 7,500 more customer care professionals in 2024 than the
stand-alone companies would have employed. &nbsp;&#147;We love the Empire State and Nassau County is a great spot for our next New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> Customer Experience Center!
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> commitment to truly taking care of customers will only get supercharged with the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and our Team of Experts approach is all about making
personal connections. That starts with great people &#151; and some of the best are in Long Island! Once this merger closes, we know Long Islanders will bring an incredible work ethic, a commitment to innovation, and amazing energy to taking care of
our customers and we can&#146;t wait to welcome them to the team!&#148; said <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> CEO John Legere. &nbsp;&#147;The New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> investment in Nassau County
exemplifies the type of corporate economic activity we hope to attract. The CEC project will provide a meaningful economic boost for our community &#150; creating up to 1,000 new and exciting job opportunities, while generating significant tax
revenue and increasing innovation. I look forward to working alongside our outstanding partners helping our residents build career skills, find employment and succeed in our community to help fill these up to 1,000
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> positions. We are pleased to collaborate with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and look forward to working with the company to bring the benefits of the New <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> to Nassau County&#146;s 1.3&nbsp;million residents,&#148; said Laura Curran, Nassau County Executive. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&nbsp;&#147;T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> strategy to build their latest
Customer Experience Center in Nassau County using Union Labor is a signal that they value the importance of what a strong middle class means to the region. Nassau County&#146;s success largely depends on companies like
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> with bold business plans. They will be an integral part of the solution to effectively transform the region at a time when the population is growing. The

in the United States. Sprint and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> together will employ more people in the U.S. than both companies would separately. Other investments include building out an industry-leading nationwide 5G network,
delivering more competition and new choice to customers like broadband, and opening new stores to an expanding customer base. &nbsp;The completion of the combination remains subject to regulatory approvals and certain other customary closing

to the diverse communities that they serve and are represented by the multicultural organizations who are party to the MOU. In doing so, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and the Multicultural Organizations acknowledge that
21st-century notions of &#145;public interest, convenience and necessity&#146; along with &#145;consumer welfare&#146; must include a commitment to diversity and inclusion. This includes spending with diverse suppliers, employing a racially diverse
