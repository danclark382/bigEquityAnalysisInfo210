between <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and Sprint. All statements other than statements of fact, including information concerning future results, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are generally
identified by the words &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;may,&#148; &#147;could&#148; or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not

conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the proposed transaction, or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions to the proposed transaction on a timely basis or at all; the occurrence of events
that may give rise to a right of one or both of the parties to terminate the business combination agreement; adverse effects on the market price of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> or Sprint&#146;s common stock and on <FONT

Sprint&#146;s operating results, including as a result of changes in key customer, supplier, employee or other business relationships; significant transaction costs, including financing costs, and unknown liabilities; failure to realize the expected
benefits and synergies of the proposed transaction in the expected timeframes or at all; costs or difficulties related to the integration of Sprint&#146;s network and operations into <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile;</FONT> the risk of
litigation or regulatory actions, including the antitrust litigation brought by the attorneys general of certain states and the District of Columbia; the inability of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> Sprint or the combined company
to retain and hire key personnel; the risk that certain contractual restrictions contained in the business combination agreement during the pendency of the proposed transaction could adversely affect
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> or Sprint&#146;s ability to pursue business opportunities or strategic transactions; effects of changes in the regulatory environment in which <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT>

follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of the date hereof, after giving effect to the consummation of the Transaction, including the making of the Loans under the Credit Agreement

contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount that would reasonably be expected to become an actual and matured liability. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Credit Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The undersigned is familiar with the business and financial position of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. In reaching the conclusions
