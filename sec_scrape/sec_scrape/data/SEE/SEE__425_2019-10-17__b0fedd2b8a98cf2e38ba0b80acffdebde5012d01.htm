 </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dear partners, </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Lately we
have been talking about the merger process taking longer than any of us anticipated. Although that is true, on Wednesday we hit another milestone that brings a renewed energy to the journey that began last year to combine Sprint and <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Federal Communications Commission has officially <B><U>approved the merger</U></B>! </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have maintained a good dialogue with the FCC throughout the process, and in May we announced a series of commitments to deliver 5G for all, create more
competition in broadband, and give American consumers &#150; including those in underserved and rural areas &#150; more choice, greater value and better service. These came on top of previous pricing commitments. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Now that the FCC has completed its review and approved our merger, we are another step closer to unveiling the new
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> While it is not time to fully celebrate, I do feel encouraged by this update and the work we have done to prepare for a unified company that will stimulate more robust competition, innovation and job
opportunities. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">

 </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I am so proud of your dedication and excitement for what&#146;s in store. Merging two disruptive companies will make a bold
difference that forces others in our industry and beyond to reconsider how they treat customers, as well as the quality of products and services that they offer them. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Throughout the hundreds of conversations, meetings and presentations with industry regulators, leaders from both companies have seized every possible
opportunity to share the incredible benefits we will unlock through the new <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The two companies deserve a fair playing field, and to prove it we have we have made real, verifiable and
enforceable commitments &#150; working with the FCC, DOJ, the states and others &#150; to guarantee we will uphold our promises. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before we can proceed,
however, remember that we still face opposition from attorneys general representing 16 states and the District of Columbia. Earlier this month Mississippi dropped out of the lawsuit, and Florida joined the consent decree with the Department of
Justice and six other states in support of the merger. The trial will begin in December unless the lawsuit is settled.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On another positive note, on
Wednesday a coalition of civil rights groups announced a <B><U>groundbreaking diversity agreement</U></B><B></B>&nbsp;that was reached with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> The Memorandum of Understanding is to expand diversity and
inclusion initiatives in a wide range of areas following the closing of our proposed merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The MOU outlines new
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> plans to create initiatives to improve diversity in the areas of corporate governance; workforce recruitment and retention; procurement and entrepreneurship; wireless services (including 5G
wireless services) for low income consumers; and philanthropy and community investment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I will continue to update you whenever I am able to, and I
appreciate your continued optimism as we focus on strengthening Sprint for our future. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">
