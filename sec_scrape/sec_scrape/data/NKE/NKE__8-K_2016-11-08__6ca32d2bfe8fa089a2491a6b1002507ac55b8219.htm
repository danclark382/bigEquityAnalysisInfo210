stock of Oracle on the New York Stock Exchange over the five (5) trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the effective time of the Merger occurred (rounded down to the nearest whole share), (ii) Oracle or one of its

cancellation (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the &#147;Compensatory Award Payments&#148;). From and after the effective time of the Merger, any such Cashed Out Compensatory Award is no longer exercisable or settleable in shares
by the former holder of such Cashed Out Compensatory Award, but instead the holder is only entitled to the payment of the Compensatory Award Payment, if any; provided that any Cashed Out Compensatory Award that has an exercise or purchase price
equal to or greater than the Offer Price was cancelled without any consideration therefor. The Compensatory Award Payments will be paid as soon as practicable following the effective time of the Merger, without interest. </P>
