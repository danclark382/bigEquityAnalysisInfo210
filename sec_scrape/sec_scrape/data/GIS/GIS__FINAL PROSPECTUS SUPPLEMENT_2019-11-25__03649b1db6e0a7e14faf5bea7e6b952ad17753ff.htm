by the entity. In the past, the company has taken the view that less than 50% of its value was derived from assets in India; however, the company has not conducted a valuation or made a determination as of the date of this prospectus supplement, and

in the amount of $0.06 per common share. In February 2018, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.075 per common share, and in February 2019, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.085 per common share,
representing a planned annual dividend of $0.34 per common share for 2019. On March 20, 2019, June&nbsp;21, 2019 and September&nbsp;20, 2019, we paid a dividend of $0.085 per common share, amounting to approximately $16.1&nbsp;million,

the duties of directors and officers of a Bermuda company are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies generally do not have the right to take action against directors or officers of the company except in very limited
circumstances and will often require leave from the Supreme Court of Bermuda to continue any proceedings they do commence. Directors of a Bermuda company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act honestly and in good faith
with a view to the best interests of the company, exercising the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the
company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. If a director of a Bermuda company is found to have
breached his or her duties to that company, he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty. A director may be liable jointly and severally with other directors if it is shown that the director knowingly engaged in
fraud or dishonesty (with such unlimited liability as the courts shall direct). In cases not involving fraud or dishonesty, the liability of the director will be determined by the Supreme Court of </P>

with respect to any matter involving or arising out of any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director or to matters which would render it void pursuant to the Companies Act. This waiver limits the rights of shareholders to assert

currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under Bermuda law, a company may declare and pay dividends from time to time unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company is or would,
after the payment, be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. Under our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bye-laws,</FONT> each common share is entitled
to dividends if, as and when dividends are declared by our board of directors. There are no restrictions in Bermuda on our ability to transfer funds (other than funds denominated in Bermuda dollars) in or out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to U.S.

agreements governing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries have incurred or may incur in the future and any other factors our board of directors deems relevant. </P>

resolution passed by a majority of the votes cast at a separate general meeting of the relevant class of shareholders at which a quorum consisting of at least two persons holding or representing by proxy the majority of the issued shares of the
relevant class is present. Our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bye-laws</FONT> specify that the creation or issue of shares ranking equally with existing shares will not, unless expressly provided by the terms of issue of existing shares, vary the
rights attached to existing shares. In addition, the creation or issue of preference shares (as regards participation in the profits or assets of the company) ranking in priority to common shares will not be deemed to vary the rights attached to
common shares or, subject to the terms of any other series of preference shares, to vary the rights attached to any other series of preference shares. </P>

discussion below with respect to passive foreign investment companies, distributions on our common shares (other than certain pro rata distributions of common shares) will be treated as dividends to the extent paid out of current or accumulated
earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. Federal income tax principles). Should any distribution exceed our current or accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital reducing your adjusted tax
basis in the common shares to the extent of your adjusted tax basis in those shares. Any remaining excess will be treated as capital gain. The amount of a distribution will include any amounts withheld by us or our paying agent in respect of Bermuda
taxes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dividends are generally taxed as ordinary income. If you are an individual, trust or estate, dividends paid on our common shares will generally be

taxation on dividends in light of your particular circumstances. The amount of the dividend will be treated as foreign-source dividend income to you and will not be eligible for the deduction generally allowed to U.S. corporations under the Code on

long-term capital gain or loss if you held the common shares for more than one year, except as provided below with respect to passive foreign investment companies. The amount of your gain or loss will be equal to the difference between your tax
basis in the common shares disposed of and the amount realized on the disposition. Such gain or loss will generally be U.S.-source gain or loss for foreign tax credit purposes; however, although the matter is not free from doubt, in the event that a
U.S. holder is otherwise subject to Indian tax on the disposition of common shares as described in &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Indian indirect transfer rules may apply on sale / acquisition of shares in certain cases,&#148; it is possible that a U.S.
holder that is eligible for the benefits of the income tax treaty between the United States and India may elect to treat gain from a sale or other disposition of our common shares that is subject to Indian tax as foreign-source gain and claim a
credit in respect of that tax (to the extent that such tax is not refundable and subject to certain other limitations). U.S. holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the election to treat disposition gain as foreign-source and the

investment-grade, interest-bearing securities until they are used for their stated purpose. We have not determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically for such purposes. As a result, management will retain broad discretion over the

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our debt securities, consisting of notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness, may be issued from time to time in one or more series pursuant to, in
the case of senior debt securities, a senior indenture to be entered into between us and a trustee to be named therein, and in the case of subordinated debt securities, a subordinated indenture to be entered into between us and a trustee to be named
therein. The terms of our debt securities will include those set forth in the indentures and those made a part of the indentures by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because the following is only a summary of selected provisions of the indentures and the debt securities, it does not contain all information that may be
important to you. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the base indentures and any supplemental indentures thereto or officer&#146;s certificate or resolution of our board of directors related thereto. We
urge you to read the indentures because the indentures, not this description, define the rights of the holders of the debt securities. The senior indenture and the subordinated indenture will be substantially in the forms included as exhibits to the
registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>General </B></P>

heading &#147;Certain Terms of the Subordinated Debt Securities &#151; Subordination.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The debt securities will be our unsecured obligations. Any
secured debt or other secured obligations will be effectively senior to the debt securities to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt or other obligations. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, with
respect to a particular series of senior debt securities, the debt securities will not be guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The applicable

at Canon&#146;s Court, 22&nbsp;Victoria&nbsp;Street, Hamilton HM 12, Bermuda. The rights of our shareholders are governed by Bermuda law and our memorandum of association and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bye-laws.</FONT> The Companies Act may

April&nbsp;12, 2019, there were 189,837,841 common shares outstanding and no preference shares are outstanding. All of our issued and outstanding shares are fully paid up. </P>

matters submitted to or requiring a vote of holders of common shares. Unless a different majority is required by Bermuda law or by our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bye-laws,</FONT> resolutions to be approved by holders of common shares may be
passed by a simple majority of votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bye-laws</FONT> provide that a quorum for such a meeting shall be two shareholders present in person or represented by proxy
and entitled to vote holding or representing shareholders holding more than 50% of the issued shares of the company carrying the right to vote at general meetings. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under Bermuda law, a company may declare and pay dividends from time to time unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company is or would,
after the payment, be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. Under our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bye-laws,</FONT> each common share is entitled
to dividends if, as and when dividends are declared by our board of directors. There are no restrictions in Bermuda on our ability to transfer funds in or out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to U.S. residents who are holders of our common shares.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any cash dividends payable to holders of our common shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange will be paid to Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our
transfer agent in the United States, for disbursement to those holders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to 2017, we did not declare regular dividends. In February 2017, we
announced the declaration of the first quarterly cash dividend on our common shares in the amount of $0.06 per common share. In February 2018, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.075 per common share, and in February 2019
we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.085 per share, representing a planned annual dividend of $0.34 per share. Any determination to pay dividends to holders of our common shares in the future, including future payment of a
regular quarterly cash dividend, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, general business conditions, statutory requirements under Bermuda law,
restrictive covenants contained in credit facility agreements governing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries have incurred or may incur in the future and any other factors our board of directors deems relevant. </P>

class, unless otherwise provided for by the terms of issue of the relevant class, may be varied either: (i)&nbsp;with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than 75% of the issued shares of that class; or (ii)&nbsp;with the sanction of a
resolution passed by a majority of the votes cast at a separate general meeting of the relevant class of shareholders at which a quorum consisting of at least two persons holding or representing by proxy the majority of the issued shares of the
relevant class is present. Our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bye-laws</FONT> specify that the creation or issue of shares ranking equally with existing shares will not, unless expressly provided by the terms of issue of existing shares, vary the
rights attached to existing shares. In addition, the creation or issue of preference shares (as regards participation in the profits or assets of the Company) ranking in priority to common shares will not be deemed to vary the rights attached to
common shares or, subject to the terms of any other series of preference shares, to vary the rights attached to any other series of preference shares. </P>

sanction of a resolution, our board of directors may authorize the purchase by our company of our own shares, of any class, at any price. To the extent permitted by Bermuda law, the shares to be purchased may be selected in any manner whatsoever,
upon such terms as our board of directors may determine in its discretion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Transfer of Common Shares </B></P>

required by law, and lodged with us, accompanied by the relevant share certificate and such other evidence of the transferor&#146;s right to make the transfer as our board of directors may reasonably require, (2)&nbsp;the transfer is in respect of
only one class of share, (3)&nbsp;the transfer is in respect of less than 5 persons jointly and (4)&nbsp;the permission of the Bermuda Monetary Authority has been obtained, if applicable. Subject to such restrictions, a holder of common shares may

person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote holding not less than 50% of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-up</FONT> capital of the company carrying the right to vote at general meetings. Bermuda law also requires that shareholders
be given at least five days&#146; advance notice of a general meeting, but the accidental omission to give notice to any person does not invalidate the proceedings at a meeting. Under our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bye-laws,</FONT> not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days&#146; notice must be given of an annual general meeting and at least five days&#146; notice of a special general meeting, must be given of a special general meeting. This notice requirement is subject to the ability to
hold such meetings on shorter notice if such notice is agreed: (i)&nbsp;in the case of an annual general meeting, by all of the shareholders entitled to attend and vote at such meeting; or (ii)&nbsp;in the case of a special general meeting, by a
majority in number of the shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the meeting holding not less than 95% in nominal value of the shares entitled to vote at such meeting. In accordance with the Companies Act, a general meeting may be held with

the preference shares to be redeemed plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends on the preference shares to the date fixed for redemption. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to the redemption price and any
other amounts per share payable on the preference shares multiplied by the fraction of a preference share represented by one depositary share. If less than all the depositary shares are to be redeemed, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be

record date for the depositary receipts relating to the preference shares will be the same date as the record date for the preference shares. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date will be entitled to instruct the depositary
as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the number of preference shares represented by that holder&#146;s depositary shares. The depositary will endeavor, insofar as practicable, to vote the number of preference shares represented by
the depositary shares in accordance with those instructions, and we will agree to take all action that may be deemed necessary by the depositary in order to enable the depositary to do so. The depositary will not vote any preference shares except to

other charges (including those in connection with receipt and distribution of dividends, the sale or exercise of rights, the withdrawal of the preference shares and the transferring, splitting or grouping of depositary receipts) as are expressly
provided in the deposit agreement to be for their accounts. If these charges have not been paid by the holders of depositary receipts, the depositary may refuse to transfer depositary shares, withhold dividends and distributions and sell the

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each debt security, depositary share, unit and warrant will be represented either by a certificate issued in definitive form to a particular investor or by
one or more global securities representing the entire issuance of securities. Unless the applicable prospectus supplement provides otherwise, certificated securities in definitive form and global securities will be issued in registered form.
Definitive securities name you or your nominee as the owner of the security, and in order to transfer or exchange these securities or to receive payments other than interest or other interim payments, you or your nominee must physically deliver the
securities to the trustee, registrar, paying agent or other agent, as applicable. Global securities name a depositary or its nominee as the owner of the debt securities, depositary shares, units or warrants represented by these global securities.
The depositary maintains a computerized system that will reflect each investor&#146;s beneficial ownership of the securities through an account maintained by the investor with its broker/dealer, bank, trust company or other representative, as we
explain more fully below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Registered Global Securities </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may issue the debt securities, depositary shares, units and warrants in the form of one or more fully registered global securities that will be deposited
with a depositary or its nominee identified in the applicable prospectus supplement and registered in the name of that depositary or nominee. In those cases, one or more registered global securities will be issued in a denomination or aggregate
denominations equal to the portion of the aggregate principal or face amount of the securities to be represented by registered global securities. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole for securities in definitive registered form, a registered
global security may not be transferred except as a whole by and among the depositary for the registered global security, the nominees of the depositary or any successors of the depositary or those nominees. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If not described below, any specific terms of the depositary arrangement with respect to any securities to be represented by a registered global security will
be described in the prospectus supplement relating to those securities. We anticipate that the following provisions will apply to all depositary arrangements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ownership of beneficial interests in a registered global security will be limited to persons, called participants, that have accounts with the depositary or
persons that may hold interests through participants. Upon the issuance of a registered global security, the depositary will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the participants&#146; accounts with the respective principal or
face amounts of the securities beneficially owned by the participants. Any dealers, underwriters or agents participating in the distribution of the securities will designate the accounts to be credited. Ownership of beneficial interests in a
registered global security will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership interests will be effected only through, records maintained by the depositary, with respect to interests of participants, and on the records of participants, with respect to
interests of persons holding through participants. The laws of some states may require that some purchasers of securities take physical delivery of these securities in definitive form. These laws may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge
beneficial interests in registered global securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So long as the depositary, or its nominee, is the registered owner of a registered global security,
that depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the securities represented by the registered global security for all purposes under the applicable indenture, warrant agreement or unit agreement.
Except as described below, owners of beneficial interests in a registered global security will not be entitled to have the securities represented by the registered global security registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive
physical delivery of the securities in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders of the securities under the applicable indenture, depositary share agreement, unit agreement or warrant agreement. Accordingly, each person
owning a beneficial interest in a registered global security must rely on the procedures of the depositary for that registered global security and, if that person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which the person
owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the applicable indenture, depositary share agreement, unit agreement or warrant agreement. We understand that </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
under existing industry practices, if we request any action of holders or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a registered global security desires to give or take any action that a holder is
entitled to give or take under the applicable indenture, depositary share agreement, unit agreement or warrant agreement, the depositary for the registered global security would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to
give or take that action, and the participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through them to give or take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners holding through them. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on debt securities, and any payments to holders with respect to warrants, units, represented by a registered
global security registered in the name of a depositary or its nominee will be made to the depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner of the registered global security. None of us, or any trustee, warrant agent, unit
agents or any other agent of ours, agent of the trustees or agent of the warrant agents or unit agents will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in
the registered global security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to those beneficial ownership interests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that
the depositary for any of the securities represented by a registered global security, upon receipt of any payment to holders of principal, premium, interest or other distribution of underlying securities or other property to holders on that
registered global security, will immediately credit participants&#146; accounts in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in that registered global security as shown on the records of the depositary. We also expect that
payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a registered global security held through participants will be governed by standing customer instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with the securities held for the
accounts of customers or registered in &#147;street name,&#148; and will be the responsibility of those participants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the depositary for any of the
securities represented by a registered global security is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and a successor depositary registered as a clearing agency under
the Exchange Act is not appointed by us within 90&nbsp;days, we will issue securities in definitive form in exchange for the registered global security that had been held by the depositary. Any securities issued in definitive form in exchange for a
registered global security will be registered in the name or names that the depositary gives to the relevant trustee, warrant agent, unit agent or other relevant agent of ours or theirs. It is expected that the depositary&#146;s instructions will be
based upon directions received by the depositary from participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the registered global security that had been held by the depositary. </P>
