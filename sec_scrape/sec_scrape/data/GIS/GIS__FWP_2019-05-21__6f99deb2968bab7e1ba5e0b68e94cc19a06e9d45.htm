<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>NEW YORK, May 21, 2019</B> &#151; Genpact Limited (NYSE: G) (&#147;Genpact&#148;), a global professional services firm focused on delivering digital

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-investor,</FONT> GIC Private Limited (&#147;GIC&#148;, and together with Bain Capital, the &#147;Selling Shareholders&#148;). The Selling Shareholders are offering approximately 27% of Genpact&#146;s shares they
beneficially own. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After giving effect to this offering, the Selling Shareholders will beneficially own approximately 15% of Genpact&#146;s outstanding
common shares. In addition, after giving effect to this offering, the number of directors that Bain Capital and its co-investors will be entitled to designate for nomination to Genpact&#146;s board of directors will be reduced to one under
Genpact&#146;s shareholder agreement with the Selling Shareholders, which provides that Bain Capital and its co-investors have the right to designate for nomination four directors to Genpact&#146;s board of directors, subject to reduction based on
certain minimum shareholding thresholds and other requirements and increases in certain circumstances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Genpact is not selling any common shares in, and
will not receive any proceeds from, the offering. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Citigroup is acting as the sole underwriter for the offering and proposes to offer the common shares

prevailing market prices, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The issuer has filed a registration statement (including

offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. </P>
