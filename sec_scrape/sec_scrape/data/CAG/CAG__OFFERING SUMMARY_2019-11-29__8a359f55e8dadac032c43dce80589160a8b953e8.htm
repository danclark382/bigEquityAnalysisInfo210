<P STYLE="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 1px; color: White">Selected Risk Considerations &#8226; You may lose a significant portion of your investment. If the underlying depreciates by more  than the buffer percentage from the initial underlying value to the final underlying value, you  will lose 1% of the stated principal amount of your securities for every 1% by which that  depreciation exceeds the buffer percentage. &#8226; The securities do not pay interest. &#8226; You will not receive dividends or have any other rights with respect to the underlying. &#8226; Your payment at maturity depends on the closing value of the underlying on a single day. &#8226; The securities are subject to the credit risk of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and  Citigroup Inc. If Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. defaults on its obligations under the  securities and Citigroup Inc. defaults on its guarantee obligations, you may not receive  anything owed to you under the securities. &#8226; The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange and you may not be able to sell  them prior to maturity. &#8226; The estimated value of the securities on the pricing date will be less than the issue price.  For more information about the estimated value of the securities, see the accompanying  preliminary pricing supplement. &#8226; The value of the securities prior to maturity will fluctuate based on many unpredictable  factors. &#8226; The issuer and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with you. &#8226; The U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities are unclear.
