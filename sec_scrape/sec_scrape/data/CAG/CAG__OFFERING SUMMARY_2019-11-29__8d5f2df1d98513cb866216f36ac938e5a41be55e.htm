<P STYLE="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 1px; color: White">Selected Risk Considerations &#8226; You may lose a significant portion of your investment. If the final underlying value of the  worst performer is less than its final barrier value, you will lose 1% of the stated principal  amount of your securities for every 1% by which the worst performer has depreciated from  its initial underlying value to its final underlying value.  There is no minimum payment at  maturity on the securities, and you may lose up to all of your investment. &#8226; Your potential for positive return from depreciation of the worst performer is limited. &#8226; The securities do not pay interest. &#8226; The securities are subject to heightened risk because they have multiple underlyings. &#8226; The securities are subject to the risks of each of the underlyings and will be negatively  affected if any one underlying performs poorly. &#8226; You will not benefit in any way from the performance of any better performing underlying. &#8226; You will be subject to risks relating to the relationship between the underlyings. &#8226; You will not receive dividends or have any other rights with respect to the underlyings. &#8226; Your payment at maturity depends on the closing value of the worst performer on a single  day. &#8226; The securities are subject to the credit risk of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and  Citigroup Inc. If Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. defaults on its obligations under the  securities and Citigroup Inc. defaults on its guarantee obligations, you may not receive  anything owed to you under the securities. &#8226; The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange and you may not be able to sell  them prior to maturity. &#8226; The estimated value of the securities on the pricing date will be less than the issue price.  For more information about the estimated value of the securities, see the accompanying  preliminary pricing supplement. &#8226; The value of the securities prior to maturity will fluctuate based on many unpredictable  factors. &#8226; The Russell 2000 &#174; Index is subject to risks associated with small capitalization stocks. &#8226; The issuer and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with you. &#8226; The U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities are unclear. The above summary of selected risks does not describe all of the risks associated with  an investment in the securities. You should read the accompanying preliminary pricing  supplement and product supplement for a more complete description of risks relating  to the securities.
