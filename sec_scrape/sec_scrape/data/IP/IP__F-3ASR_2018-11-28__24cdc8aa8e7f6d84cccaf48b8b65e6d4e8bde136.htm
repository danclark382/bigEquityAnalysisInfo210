diversified communications services to the world&#146;s leading media companies, fixed and wireless telecommunications operators, data networking service providers for enterprise and mobile applications in the air and on the seas, multinational
corporations and Internet Service Providers (&#147;ISPs&#148;). We are also the leading provider of commercial satellite capacity to the U.S. government and other select military organizations and their contractors. Our network solutions are a
critical component of our customers&#146; infrastructures and business models. Generally, our customers need the specialized connectivity that satellites provide so long as they are in business or pursuing their mission. In recent years, mobility
services providers have contracted for services on our fleet that support broadband connections for passengers on commercial flights and cruise ships, connectivity that in some cases is only available through our network. In addition, our satellite
neighborhoods provide our media customers with efficient and reliable broadcast distribution that maximizes audience reach, a technical and economic benefit that is difficult for terrestrial services to match. In developing regions, our satellite
solutions often provide higher reliability than is available from local terrestrial telecommunications services and allow our customers to reach geographies that they would otherwise be unable to serve. </P>
